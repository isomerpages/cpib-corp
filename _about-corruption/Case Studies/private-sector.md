<p>Dutch Marine Engineer, Cornelius Van der Horst was the Repair and Technical
Manager of Petroleum Shipping Ltd, a subsidiary of Exxon Corporation. Van
der Horst oversees the maintenance and repair of Exxon’s tankers worldwide,
including managing the tenders for contracts and making recommendations
to his senior management on which bids to accept.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Investigations revealed that in early 1990s, Keppel Shipyard’s marketing
manager first met Van der Horst in Holland to understand why Keppel had
been unsuccessful in obtaining contracts with Petroleum Shipping. In 1991,
they met again in Singapore together with another Keppel Shipyard senior
executive. Subsequently in 1992, a contract was awarded to Keppel Shipyard
by Petroleum Shipping. When the bill for the job was given, Van der Horst
had objected to the amount and referenced an earlier conversation he had
with the Keppel Shipyard executives. This information was then passed on
to other Keppel Directors, who after discussing the matter, decided to
give Van der Horst a cut of 1 per cent of the contract sum for all tenders
awarded to Keppel Shipyard by Petroleum Shipping. From January 1992 to
May 1995, a total of S$8,527,343.30 was remitted by Keppel Shipyard into
Van der Horst’s bank accounts held in Singapore so that the latter would
assist Keppel Shipyard in securing tenders for ship repair jobs with Petroleum
Shipping Ltd. This included providing information about Keppel Shipyard’s
competitors’ tenders, including the price and deadline to complete a job,
to Keppel Shipyard.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On 22 December 1997, Keppel Shipyard, who was represented in Court by
its financial controller, Wong Ngiam Jih, pleaded guilty to three charges
of corruption, and the company was fined a total of S$300,000. 14 other
charges against Keppel Shipyard were taken into consideration during sentencing.
Van der Horst had also pleaded guilty to corruption charges in a Southampton
court in 1996, and has been sentenced to three years’ imprisonment.</p>

<p>Getax Ocean Trades Pte Ltd (Getax Ocean), a Singapore incorporated company,
was the logistics arm of Getax Australia Pty Ltd (Getax Australia). The
company was in charge of chartering and arranging vessels for Getax Australia’s
phosphate shipments. Getax Australia’s core business at that time was the
export of phosphates from Togo and Nauru, and the import of the same to
India.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Investigations by the CPIB revealed that in January 2010, a Director at
Getax Australia had contacted Ryke Solomon, a Member of Parliament of the
Republic of Nauru, expressing his interest in advancing his company’s interest
with the Republic of Nauru Phosphate Corporation. Solomon subsequently
asked for at least USD$30,000 to fund his re-election campaign in Nauru.
On 18 February 2010, the same Director directed a manager at Getax Ocean
to transfer USD$20,000 from a Citibank account belonging to an agent of
Getax Ocean to the personal bank account of Solomon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Getax Ocean was charged on 28 July 2016 with one count of corruptly giving
about USD$20,000 to Solomon as an inducement to advance the business interests
of Getax Australia with the Republic of Nauru. On 28 June 2018, Getax Ocean
Trades Pte Ltd was fined $80,000 for corruption.</p>

<p>Peh Chew Seng was the Deputy Director of Projects and Development at Tan
Tock Seng Hospital. He was in charge of the construction of a temporary
4-storey office next to the hospital’s main building.
<br>
</p>
<p>Investigations by the CPIB found that sometime in early 2009, Peh had
contacted his friend, Sim Geok Soon, an executive director of Trans Equatorial
Engineering Pte Ltd about the construction project. Peh had asked Sim if
his company would be keen to submit a tender for the project. Sim responded
that another affiliated company, PBT Engineering Pte Ltd, was interested
in the job. Through Sim, Peh was introduced to Phua Boon Kin, executive
director of PBT Engineering Pte Ltd. Prior to meeting Phua, Peh had told
Sim that if PBT Engineering was successful in tendering for the project,
he expected something in return. Sim then informed Phua of Peh’s request
for the commission, to which Phua agreed. Peh’s misdeeds eventually came
to light when he contacted the building project consultant to disqualify
the three lowest bids from running for the tender and to put PBT Engineering
Pte Ltd through to the next round of assessment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Peh Chew Seng was found guilty of corruption by the Court and was sentenced
to six weeks imprisonment on 12 September 2012.</p>

<p>Goh Peng Choy was a Senior Procurement Executive with Advanced Material
Engineering Pte Ltd (AME), a wholly owned subsidiary of ST Kinetics Ltd.
He had abused his position to obtain bribes from several contractors of
AME in return for divulging AME’s internal price list which is confidential
information or showing favour to the contractors. All the bribe monies
were given in cash to Goh Peng Choy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Goh Peng Choy had concealed the bribe monies with the assistance of his
brother, Goh Peng Kee. The latter had hidden the cash in his residence.
Goh Peng Choy had also instructed his brother and sister-in-law to open
bank accounts to deposit part of bribe monies. S$385,000 was found in Goh
Peng Kee’s safe. A further S$100,767.03 was recovered from the bank accounts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Goh Peng Choy was subsequently charged for both corruption and money laundering
offences. On 17 February 2014, he pleaded guilty to 4 corruption charges
and one money laundering offence and was sentenced to 22 months’ imprisonment.
The Judge also ordered him to pay a penalty of S$372,923 while S$12,077
was forfeited to the State. A total of S$485,767.03 was recovered.</p>

<p>Teh Hang Peng was a Material Controller with the Singapore Technologies
Logistics Pte Ltd (ST Log) and was based at the warehouse in Tuas Naval
Base (TNB), Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN). His duties as a Material
Controller were to check that the goods delivered to the Tuas Naval Base
are of the correct description and quantity based on the Purchase Orders
and Delivery Orders as required by the Republic of Singapore Navy. From
January 2003 to July 2004, Teh was found to have obtained a total of S$9,300
in return for assisting Lim Teck Beng, then the manager of JP Marine (SEA)
Pte Ltd, to supply locally fabricated marine spare parts to TNB and passing
them off as imported originals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The CPIB started investigating the case after it had received information.
Its investigation revealed that Teh had given assistance to Lim in various
ways. Teh had smuggled existing stock from the TNB warehouse and passed
the parts to Lim. Lim subsequently brought these “samples” to the fabricators
and fabricated similar ones that were disguised as those produced by the
Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) before supplying to the RSN. He
then checked the part numbers, origins and functions at the warehouse and
subsequently passed the information to Lim. Teh had also removed packing
labels and sticker from existing stock in the warehouse, together with
the description on how the items were normally packed by the OEM overseas,
and passed them over to Lim to reproduce. In addition, Teh had informed
Lim of the work schedule of the Quality Assistance (QA) Inspectors. Lim
needed the information as he would prefer to deliver the fabricated parts
to the TNB warehouse at those times when the known meticulous QA Inspectors
were off duty.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Teh Hang Peng was consequently fined S$60,000 and ordered to pay a penalty*
of S$9,300 in November 2004 for corruption offences. Lim, on the other
hand was fined S$72,000.</p>
<p></p>
<p>* Penalty is an additional punishment (for corruption offences) imposed
on the bribe taker to pay a sum which is equal to the amount of that gratification.</p>

<p>Chua Kim Guan was a Managing Director of Jin Li Mould Manufacturing Pte
Ltd and was in charge of the operations in the company. Ang Kok Kiat was
the Sales Director of the same company. The company is in the business
of producing moulds and has had business dealings with Apple Inc since
2001.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The CPIB received information on the case and investigation had shown
that between November 2006 to June 2009, the duo had worked together to
give bribes to one Paul Shin Devine, a Global Supply Manager under the
employment of Apple Inc. In return, Devine would provide information on
Apple Inc’s upcoming projects such as product forecasts and pricing targets
so that Jin Li Mould Manufacturing Pte Ltd could secure the contracts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Chua had allegedly given a total of US$387,600 to Devine over a course
of 2 years in Singapore, Macau, People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the
United States of America (USA) to advance Jin Li Mould Manufacturing Pte
Ltd’s business interests. Ang had abetted these transactions as well as
those involving two other Singaporean companies, Fastening Technology Pte
Ltd and Lateral Solutions Pte Ltd. Moreover, he had also received payments
from the shareholders of the two companies, for aiding them to secure business
contracts from Apple Inc through Devine. He also received from Devine for
his assistance in the transactions with Jin Li Mould Manufacturing Pte
Ltd, Fastening Technology Pte Ltd and Lateral Solutions Pte Ltd.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In December 2013, Chua Kim Guan was jailed for 9 months for giving bribes
to Paul Shin Devine to advance his company’s business interests with Apple
Inc. Ang Kok Kiat was sentenced to imprisonment of 12 months and ordered
to pay a penalty* of S$281,985.51. Paul Shin Devine had pleaded guilty
earlier in the US Federal Court in February 2011 to wire fraud, conspiracy
and money laundering.</p>

<p>Leng Kah Poh was the IKEA Food Service Manager for Ikano Pte Ltd (IKEA
Singapore). Being the top man in charge of IKEA Food Service, he had a
free hand in making most of the decisions related to the restaurant operations
including approving food suppliers to IKEA Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The CPIB received information on the case and its investigation revealed
that sometime in 2002, Leng got acquainted with Lim Kim Seng, the sole
proprietor of Buildcare Services who performed cleaning works for IKEA
Singapore’s restaurants. The latter approached Leng with a business proposal
to replace IKEA Singapore’s existing food supplier. He introduced Tee Fook
Boon, the sole proprietor of AT35 to Leng. Subsequently, AT35 managed to
take over the supply of raw food ingredients from IKEA Singapore’s existing
supplier with the assistance and recommendation of Leng. Part of the company
(AT35)’s profits went to Leng even though he did not contribute to the
initial capital investment to finance their business scheme. Later, Lim
set up Food Royale Trading (FRT) to supply chilled and dry food products
to IKEA Singapore. AT35 and FRT then became the exclusive suppliers of
frozen, chilled and dried food ingredients and products to IKEA Singapore.
Leng continued to exercise his influence and favour the two companies.
He would give insider information on how to make AT35’s and FRT’s products
attractive to IKEA Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over a period of about 7 years, through AT35 and FRT, Lim Kim Seng, Tee
Fook Boon and Leng Kah Poh amassed for themselves S$6.9 million out of
the company profits from the food supply contracts with IKEA Singapore.
Leng took a one-third share for his pivotal role in their business scheme,
in the amount of about S$2.3 million.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All 3 persons were charged and convicted for corruption offences. Leng
Kah Poh was convicted by a District Court in July 2013 but was later acquitted
in September 2013 by the High Court. The High Court decision was then overturned
by the Court of Appeal in November 2014, which restored Leng’s original
sentence of 98 weeks imprisonment and S$2,341,508 penalty* on the corrupt
proceeds he received. Lim Kim Seng was convicted and sentenced to 70 weeks
imprisonment in 2013. Tee Fook Boon was originally convicted by a District
Court to 16 weeks imprisonment and fine of S$180,000. Subsequently, Tee’s
imprisonment was enhanced to 40 weeks with the fine amount remaining unchanged
on 22 August 2011.</p>
