<p>Dutch Marine Engineer, Cornelius Van der Horst was the Repair and Technical
Manager of Petroleum Shipping Ltd, a subsidiary of Exxon Corporation. Van
der Horst oversees the maintenance and repair of Exxon’s tankers worldwide,
including managing the tenders for contracts and making recommendations
to his senior management on which bids to accept.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Investigations revealed that in early 1990s, Keppel Shipyard’s marketing
manager first met Van der Horst in Holland to understand why Keppel had
been unsuccessful in obtaining contracts with Petroleum Shipping. In 1991,
they met again in Singapore together with another Keppel Shipyard senior
executive. Subsequently in 1992, a contract was awarded to Keppel Shipyard
by Petroleum Shipping. When the bill for the job was given, Van der Horst
had objected to the amount and referenced an earlier conversation he had
with the Keppel Shipyard executives. This information was then passed on
to other Keppel Directors, who after discussing the matter, decided to
give Van der Horst a cut of 1 per cent of the contract sum for all tenders
awarded to Keppel Shipyard by Petroleum Shipping. From January 1992 to
May 1995, a total of S$8,527,343.30 was remitted by Keppel Shipyard into
Van der Horst’s bank accounts held in Singapore so that the latter would
assist Keppel Shipyard in securing tenders for ship repair jobs with Petroleum
Shipping Ltd. This included providing information about Keppel Shipyard’s
competitors’ tenders, including the price and deadline to complete a job,
to Keppel Shipyard.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On 22 December 1997, Keppel Shipyard, who was represented in Court by
its financial controller, Wong Ngiam Jih, pleaded guilty to three charges
of corruption, and the company was fined a total of S$300,000. 14 other
charges against Keppel Shipyard were taken into consideration during sentencing.
Van der Horst had also pleaded guilty to corruption charges in a Southampton
court in 1996, and has been sentenced to three years’ imprisonment.</p>

<p>Getax Ocean Trades Pte Ltd (Getax Ocean), a Singapore incorporated company,
was the logistics arm of Getax Australia Pty Ltd (Getax Australia). The
company was in charge of chartering and arranging vessels for Getax Australia’s
phosphate shipments. Getax Australia’s core business at that time was the
export of phosphates from Togo and Nauru, and the import of the same to
India.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Investigations by the CPIB revealed that in January 2010, a Director at
Getax Australia had contacted Ryke Solomon, a Member of Parliament of the
Republic of Nauru, expressing his interest in advancing his company’s interest
with the Republic of Nauru Phosphate Corporation. Solomon subsequently
asked for at least USD$30,000 to fund his re-election campaign in Nauru.
On 18 February 2010, the same Director directed a manager at Getax Ocean
to transfer USD$20,000 from a Citibank account belonging to an agent of
Getax Ocean to the personal bank account of Solomon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Getax Ocean was charged on 28 July 2016 with one count of corruptly giving
about USD$20,000 to Solomon as an inducement to advance the business interests
of Getax Australia with the Republic of Nauru. On 28 June 2018, Getax Ocean
Trades Pte Ltd was fined $80,000 for corruption.</p>

<p>Peh Chew Seng was the Deputy Director of Projects and Development at Tan
Tock Seng Hospital. He was in charge of the construction of a temporary
4-storey office next to the hospital’s main building.
<br>
</p>
<p>Investigations by the CPIB found that sometime in early 2009, Peh had
contacted his friend, Sim Geok Soon, an executive director of Trans Equatorial
Engineering Pte Ltd about the construction project. Peh had asked Sim if
his company would be keen to submit a tender for the project. Sim responded
that another affiliated company, PBT Engineering Pte Ltd, was interested
in the job. Through Sim, Peh was introduced to Phua Boon Kin, executive
director of PBT Engineering Pte Ltd. Prior to meeting Phua, Peh had told
Sim that if PBT Engineering was successful in tendering for the project,
he expected something in return. Sim then informed Phua of Peh’s request
for the commission, to which Phua agreed. Peh’s misdeeds eventually came
to light when he contacted the building project consultant to disqualify
the three lowest bids from running for the tender and to put PBT Engineering
Pte Ltd through to the next round of assessment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Peh Chew Seng was found guilty of corruption by the Court and was sentenced
to six weeks imprisonment on 12 September 2012.</p>

<p>Goh Peng Choy was a Senior Procurement Executive with Advanced Material
Engineering Pte Ltd (AME), a wholly owned subsidiary of ST Kinetics Ltd.
He had abused his position to obtain bribes from several contractors of
AME in return for divulging AME’s internal price list which is confidential
information or showing favour to the contractors. All the bribe monies
were given in cash to Goh Peng Choy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Goh Peng Choy had concealed the bribe monies with the assistance of his
brother, Goh Peng Kee. The latter had hidden the cash in his residence.
Goh Peng Choy had also instructed his brother and sister-in-law to open
bank accounts to deposit part of bribe monies. S$385,000 was found in Goh
Peng Kee’s safe. A further S$100,767.03 was recovered from the bank accounts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Goh Peng Choy was subsequently charged for both corruption and money laundering
offences. On 17 February 2014, he pleaded guilty to 4 corruption charges
and one money laundering offence and was sentenced to 22 months’ imprisonment.
The Judge also ordered him to pay a penalty of S$372,923 while S$12,077
was forfeited to the State. A total of S$485,767.03 was recovered.</p>

<p>Teh Hang Peng was a Material Controller with the Singapore Technologies
Logistics Pte Ltd (ST Log) and was based at the warehouse in Tuas Naval
Base (TNB), Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN). His duties as a Material
Controller were to check that the goods delivered to the Tuas Naval Base
are of the correct description and quantity based on the Purchase Orders
and Delivery Orders as required by the Republic of Singapore Navy. From
January 2003 to July 2004, Teh was found to have obtained a total of S$9,300
in return for assisting Lim Teck Beng, then the manager of JP Marine (SEA)
Pte Ltd, to supply locally fabricated marine spare parts to TNB and passing
them off as imported originals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The CPIB started investigating the case after it had received information.
Its investigation revealed that Teh had given assistance to Lim in various
ways. Teh had smuggled existing stock from the TNB warehouse and passed
the parts to Lim. Lim subsequently brought these “samples” to the fabricators
and fabricated similar ones that were disguised as those produced by the
Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) before supplying to the RSN. He
then checked the part numbers, origins and functions at the warehouse and
subsequently passed the information to Lim. Teh had also removed packing
labels and sticker from existing stock in the warehouse, together with
the description on how the items were normally packed by the OEM overseas,
and passed them over to Lim to reproduce. In addition, Teh had informed
Lim of the work schedule of the Quality Assistance (QA) Inspectors. Lim
needed the information as he would prefer to deliver the fabricated parts
to the TNB warehouse at those times when the known meticulous QA Inspectors
were off duty.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Teh Hang Peng was consequently fined S$60,000 and ordered to pay a penalty*
of S$9,300 in November 2004 for corruption offences. Lim, on the other
hand was fined S$72,000.</p>
<p></p>
<p>* Penalty is an additional punishment (for corruption offences) imposed
on the bribe taker to pay a sum which is equal to the amount of that gratification.</p>
