<p>The Singapore Police Force, the Central Narcotics Bureau, and the Corrupt
Practices Investigation Bureau are the three law enforcement agencies responsible
for investigating money laundering in Singapore. To tackle the key threats
identified in the 2024 Money Laundering National Risk Assessment and support
Singapore's anti-money laundering strategy, the agencies have identified
key focus areas to prioritise money laundering and guide investigations.
This enables law enforcement to keep pace with the evolving risks and typologies
of money laundering and take firm enforcement action against criminals
seeking to launder their proceeds of crime through Singapore's financial
system.</p>
