<p><strong>1871</strong>
</p>
<p>Corruption thrived in Singapore during the colonial period as it was perceived
that corrupt offenders were unlikely to be detected and punished. In 1871,
corruption was made illegal. However, nothing concrete was done.</p>

<p><strong>1937</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In December 1937, the first anti-corruption legislation was introduced
with the enactment of the Prevention of Corruption Ordinance (POCO). The
rationale for POCO was ‘the prevention of bribery and secret commissions
in public and private business’. However, the British colonial government
failed to curb corruption as POCO and the Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB)
under the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) were relatively ineffective.
The POCO specified only three instances of corrupt behaviour and was a
short document of 12 sections that were limited in scope. Moreover, corruption
under the POCO was a non-seizable offence. Limited powers of investigation
afforded by the POCO to investigation officers stifled their ability to
effectively tackle corruption.</p>

<p><strong>1946</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Prevention of Corruption Ordinance (POCO) was revised in 1946, making
corrupt offences seizable, and giving police officers much wider powers
of arrest, search and investigation to combat corruption. Nonetheless,
the revised legislation could not make up for the fact that the Anti-Corruption
Branch (ACB) remained largely ineffective. The ACB’s responsibility to
combat corruption was hampered by its limited manpower. Moreover, the ACB
had to contend with other branches of the Criminal Investigation Department
(CID) for resources. The principal reason for ACB’s inadequacies was its
inability to curtail the prevalence of police corruption in colonial Singapore.</p>

<p><strong>1951</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In October 1951, a consignment of 1,800 pounds of opium worth $400,000
was hijacked at Punggol Beach and the robbers included three police detectives.
A special team headed by officers of the Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) was
appointed to investigate the case. Although some senior police officers
were found to be involved in the hijacking, only one Assistant Superintendent
was dismissed and another officer was retired. Due to ACB’s inability to
garner sufficient evidence, the remaining officers were neither prosecuted
nor convicted. As a result, in April 1952, the government brought together
a Special Investigations Team comprising R Middleton-Smith, RB Corridon
from Special Branch, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) BM Finch
from the Courts and later Acting ASP Ho Kah Soon, also from Special Branch,
to review the deficiencies in the ACB’s investigation of the opium heist.

<p><strong>1952</strong>
</p>
<p>The Anti-Corruption Branch’s (ACB) failure to curb corruption appalled
the colonial government and subsequently led to the ACB’s demise. The colonial
government decided to retain the Special Investigations Team, resulting
in the inception of the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau in September
1952 which came under the purview of the Attorney-General. Middleton-Smith
assumed the position of Director of CPIB and he reported directly to the
Colonial Secretary. The CPIB was a lean outfit of 13 officers as of October
1952, and its investigation officers were generally on short secondment
to the Bureau. Then, the Bureau was located at the second-level of the
Supreme Court Building at High Street. Middleton-Smith noted back then
that the Bureau’s location at the Supreme Court would be of ‘psychological
importance’ to the public, reinforcing the Bureau’s authority in the battle
against corruption. Unfortunately, the officers’ short secondment and limited
time and capacity to conduct thorough investigations undermined the effective
operations of CPIB. There was also a social stigma of investigating fellow
police officers. Thus, corruption, especially in its syndicated form amongst
law enforcement officers, continued to thrive in the colonial society.</p>
