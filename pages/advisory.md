<p><strong>Advisory on Impersonation Scam Involving CPIB</strong>
</p>
<p>The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) is aware of several
impersonation scams involving the Bureau.</p>
<p>2. In a recent incident, a member of public has received several calls
purportedly from the CPIB, claiming that a handphone number, belonging
to the member of public's relative, was used to make scam call advertisements
in Malaysia. In another separate incident, a member of public received
a call supposedly from CPIB, claiming that the member of public's personal
details was used for a freight account. We would like to clarify that the
calls were <u>not</u> made by CPIB officers.</p>
<p>3. Members of the public are advised to take the following precautions
if they receive such calls:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Ignore the calls and the caller's instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call CPIBâ€™s hotline at 1800-376-0000* for assistance to verify the authenticity
of such calls purported to be from the CPIB. You can also check the legitimacy
of suspicious messages, phone numbers and website links via the ScamShield
app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not provide your personal information such as your name, identification
number, passport details, contact details, bank credentials and One-Time
Password to the requestor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>4. Remember, government officials will NEVER do these things over a phone
call:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Ask you to transfer of money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask you to disclose personal or banking details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask you to install mobile apps from unofficial app stores.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer your call directly to Police, except when you call 995 for life-threatening
emergencies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>5. If you receive an SMS from the government, make sure it is sent from
the gov.sg SMS Sender ID**.</p>
<p>6. Scammers may also cite your personal information (e.g., name or NRIC
number) to appear legitimate. Do not automatically trust someone just because
he/she has your personal information.</p>
<p>7. If you have any information on suspected scams involving the impersonation
of CPIB or its officers, please call the CPIB hotline at 1800-376-0000*,
