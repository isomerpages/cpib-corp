<p><strong>Advisory on Impersonation Scam Involving CPIB</strong>
</p>
<p>The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) is aware of an impersonation
scam involving the Bureau.</p>
<p>2. In a recent incident, a member of public received a suspected scam
text message from a handphone number purporting to be from CPIB, instructing
to wire funds into a bank account belonging to a CPIB Investigation Officer.
We would like to clarify that the text message was <u>not</u> sent by CPIB.</p>
<p>3. Members of the public are advised to take the following precautions:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Ignore the message and the requestor’s instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call CPIB’s hotline at 1800-376-0000* for assistance to verify the authenticity
of such messages, phone numbers and website links purported to be from
the CPIB. You can also check via the 24/7 ScamShield Helpline at 1799 or
the ScamShield app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not provide your personal information such as your name, identification
number, passport details, contact details, bank credentials and One-Time
Password to the requestor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>4. As a reminder, Government officials will <strong><u>never</u></strong> do
these things over a message or phone call:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Ask you to transfer money;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask you to disclose bank log-in details;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask you to install mobile apps from unofficial app stores;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer your call directly to Police.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>5. If you receive an SMS from the Government, make sure it is sent from
the gov.sg SMS Sender ID**.</p>
<p>6. Scammers may also cite your personal information (e.g. name or NRIC
number) to appear legitimate. Do not automatically trust someone just because
he/she has your personal information.</p>
<p>7. If you have any information on suspected scams involving the impersonation
of CPIB or its officers, please call the CPIB hotline at 1800-376-0000*,
the Police hotline at 1800-255-0000* or submit it online at <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.police.gov.sg/iwitness</a>.</p>
