<p><strong>Advisory on Impersonation Scam Involving CPIB</strong>
</p>
<p>The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) is aware of an impersonation
scam involving the Bureau.</p>
<p>2. In a recent incident,&nbsp;a member of public has received a letter
purportedly from the&nbsp;CPIB via a Whatsapp message. The Whatsapp message
accompanying the letter had requested for payment from the individual relating
to suspected money laundering offences.</p>
<p>3. Members of the public are advised to take the following precautions
if they receive such purported CPIB documents which may be dubious in nature:</p>
<p>a) Call CPIBâ€™s hotline at 1800-376-0000* for assistance to verify the
authenticity of the documents purported to be from CPIB.</p>
<p>b) Do not remit or transfer any money for any transactions based on instructions
which may be included in such documents.</p>
<p>c) Refrain from providing personal information such as your One-Time Password
(OTP) and bank credentials to the requestor.</p>
<p>4. CPIB takes a serious view of the impersonation of public agencies for
undesirable or scam purposes. If you have any information on suspected
scams based on the impersonation of CPIB or its officers, please call the
CPIB hotline at 1800-376-0000*, the Police hotline at 1800-255-0000*, or
