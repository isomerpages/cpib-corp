<p>On 16 August 2024, Poo Tze Chiang (“Poo”) (符志强, 47-year-old male Singaporean),
a Police Officer of the Singapore Police Force at the material time, was
sentenced to 78 months’ imprisonment and ordered to pay a penalty of S$32,500
for corruption and obstructing the course of justice.</p>
<p><strong>First Corruption Offence Relating to Poo’s dealings with Chan and Wang</strong>
</p>
<p>2. Investigations revealed that on or about 14 September 2019, at a club
along Orchard Road, an altercation broke out between members of two rival
gangs. Following the altercation, one Wang Huate (“Wang”, 王华特) was arrested.
A few days later, Wang’s associate, one Cordell Chan Yuen Kwang (“Chan”),
sought assistance from one Ng Chuan Seng (“Ng”, 黄泉胜)<sup>1</sup>, as Chan
was concerned that the Police would take action against him and Wang for
their involvement in the altercation. Ng arranged for Chan and Wang to
meet Poo at Ng’s KTV located along Geylang Road. Ng suggested that Chan
and Wang could give a “red packet” to Poo for his assistance in “settling”
the fighting incident. During their meeting with Poo, Chan and Wang gave
Poo a red packet containing S$2,000 in cash.</p>

</p>
<p>3. Sometime in February 2020, Wang was remanded by the Police for further
investigations. Upon his release, Wang contacted Chan and asked if he could
seek Poo’s assistance regarding the Police’s investigations. Poo informed
Chan that Wang had to pay him S$20,000 for his assistance. On the night
of 22 February 2020, Poo, Chan, and Wang met in a car park along Hillview
Rise. At the car park, Wang handed over to Poo a plastic bag containing
S$20,000 in cash.</p>
<p>4. On 5 August 2020, Poo called Chan and told him that Wang would be detained
by the Police if Wang reported for bail that day. Chan immediately contacted
Wang and relayed Poo’s message to Wang. Wang therefore decided not to report
for bail to avoid being detained.</p>
<p>5. On the same day, Poo, Chan, and Wang met at a void deck in the vicinity
of Bukit Batok. Two Police officers who were patrolling the area approached
the trio (Poo, Chan and Wang) to conduct a spot check. Before the two Police
officers could conduct the spot check, Poo approached the two Police officers,
flashed his warrant card and identified himself as a Police officer from
the Secret Societies Branch. Poo then lied to the two Police officers that
he was “conducting operations” with the hope to dissuade them from conducting
a spot check on Chan and Wang. As a result of Poo’s lies, the two Police
officers did not proceed with the spot check on Chan and Wang and left
the area.</p>
<p><strong>Further Corruption and Obstruction of Justice Offences Relating to Poo’s dealings with Chan</strong>
</p>
<p>6. In August 2020, Chan learned that the Police were pursuing him. On
22 August 2020, Chan met Poo and asked Poo for assistance with the Police’s
investigations against him. Poo asked for S$10,000 in exchange for his
assistance. Chan ultimately agreed to pay Poo a sum of S$7,000. On 22 August
2020, Chan handed over S$5,000 in cash to Poo. Sometime in September 2020,
Chan handed over the remaining S$2,000 in cash to Poo.</p>
<p>7. On Poo’s request, between November 2019 and September 2020, Chan also
gave Poo loans totalling S$3,500 so that Poo would provide him with assistance
regarding Police’s investigations against him.</p>
<p>8. On or about 25 November 2020, Chan parked his car at a car park in
Bukit Batok and went with Poo for a meal. After the meal, Poo drove Chan
to the car park where Chan’s car had been parked. Poo noticed an unmarked
car from the Secret Societies Branch parked in the car park. Knowing that
Chan was wanted by the Police, Poo informed Chan that he had seen his colleague’s
car and told Chan to alight from his car and head to a nearby coffeeshop.
Chan fled the area and was able to evade detection. Some time later, Poo
informed Chan that his colleagues were still in the vicinity of the car
park. Chan decided not to return to his car and decided instead to take
a taxi home to avoid being apprehended by the Police. Had the Police seen
Chan at the car park, they would have detained him.</p>
<p>9. In total, Poo corruptly accepted or obtained gratifications in the
form of cash and loans amounting to S$32,500, from Chan and Wang. In exchange,
he shielded them from Police action on three occasions. Accordingly, Poo
was charged on 22 November 2022 with seven counts of corruption and three
counts of obstructing the course of justice.</p>
<p>10. Poo was charged on 26 January 2024 with additional counts of corruption
and cheating for a separate case involving one Chen Guangyun (陈光云). This
case is still before the Courts.</p>
<p>11. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person who is convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of
the Prevention of Corruption Act can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced
to imprisonment of up to five years or to both. Any person who is convicted
of an offence under Section 204A of the Penal Code can be sentenced to
imprisonment of up to seven years, a fine, or both.</p>
