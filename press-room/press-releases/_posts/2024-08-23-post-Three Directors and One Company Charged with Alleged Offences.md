<p>On 23 August 2024, the following three individuals and one company were
charged in Court with alleged corruption, cheating and money laundering
offences. They are:</p>
<p>a) Yap Chin Chye Alvin (“Alvin”) (叶进才, 49-year-old male Singaporean),
a Sales Director of Geekplus SG Pte Ltd (“Geekplus”) at the material time;</p>
<p>b) Lee Mui Sim (“Ashelyn”) (李枚芯, 53-year-old female Singaporean), a Logistics
Director of Henatenn Holdings Pte Ltd (“Henatenn”) at the material time;</p>
<p>c) Quek Chin Hock Alex (“Alex”) (50-year-old male Singaporean), a Co-Director
and shareholder of ECT Asia Pte Ltd at the material time; and</p>
<p>d) ECT Asia Pte Ltd (“ECT Asia”).</p>
<p><em>Alleged Corruption and Cheating Offences In Relation To A Warehouse Automation Contract </em>
</p>
<p>2. Between 18 May and 7 December 2022, Alvin was alleged to have corruptly
given Ashelyn and Alex a sum amounting to about S$67,485 over two occasions.
These gratifications were purportedly given in return for recommending
Henatenn to contract with Geekplus for their warehouse automation services
and giving confidential information to Alvin to make Geekplus’ services
more attractive to Henatenn.</p>
<p>3. Over the same period, Ashelyn and Alex were alleged to have conspired
with Alvin to deceive Geek Plus International Company Limited<sup>1</sup> into
approving the payment of sums totaling S$101,235 from Geekplus to ECT Asia’s
bank account. ECT Asia purportedly provided consultancy services to Geekplus.</p>
<p>4. For their actions relating to Henatenn contracting with Geekplus for
their warehouse automation services, Ashelyn and Alex each face two charges
under section 6(a) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em> and one charge
under Section 420 read with Section 109 of the <em>Penal Code</em> which
is amalgamated pursuant to Section 124(4) of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em>.
Correspondingly, Alvin faces two charges under Section 6(b) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em> and
one charge under Section 420 of the <em>Penal Code</em> which is amalgamated
pursuant to Section 124(4) of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em>.</p>
<p><em>Alleged Cheating Offences In Relation To The Purchase Of Shuttle Robots</em> 
</p>
<p>5. Between 24 August and 21 December 2022, Alex and Alvin were alleged
to have conspired with Ashelyn to cheat Henatenn by inflating the selling
price of each unit of shuttle robots supplied from Geekplus to Henatenn
from US$35,000 to US$45,000. It is alleged that this induced Henatenn to
pay additional sums amounting to S$67,550 to Geekplus for five shuttle
robots.</p>
<p>6. Thereafter, around 12 October 2022, Ashelyn and Alex were alleged to
have conspired with Alvin to deceive Geek Plus International Company Limited
into approving the payments of sums totaling S$67,550 from Geekplus to
ECT Asia’s bank account.</p>
<p>7. For his actions relating to Henatenn’s purchase of shuttle robots from
Geekplus, Alvin faces two charges under Section 420 of the <em>Penal Code</em>,
of which one charge is read with Section 109 of the <em>Penal Code</em> and
is amalgamated pursuant to Section 124(4) of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em>.
Correspondingly, Ashelyn and Alex each face two charges under Section 420
read with Section 109 of the <em>Penal Code</em>, of which one charge is
amalgamated pursuant to Section 124(4) of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em>.</p>
<p><em>Alleged Cheating Offences In Relation To Fictitious Invoices</em> 
</p>
<p>8. Sometime between 23 November 2021 to 1 December 2022, Alvin was alleged
to have conspired with Alex to cheat Geekplus by submitting fictitious
invoices created by Alex of ECT Asia on three occasions in relation to
rental of office space. It is alleged that the deceptive scheme induced
Geekplus to make payments of S$1,500 and S$3,000 to Alvin’s bank account
and ECT Asia, respectively.</p>
<p>9. For his actions relating to the alleged submission of fictitious invoices,
Alvin faces two charges under Section 420 of the <em>Penal Code,</em> of
which one charge is amalgamated pursuant to Section 124(4) of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em>.
Correspondingly, Alex faces two charges under Section 420 read with Section
109 of the <em>Penal Code</em>, of which one charge is amalgamated pursuant
to Section 124(4) of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em>.</p>
<p><em>Alleged Money Laundering Offences</em>
</p>
<p>10. Sometime between May to October 2022, Alex and Ashelyn were alleged
to have used the purportedly corrupt commission payments and the marking
up of the shuttle robot price relating to the warehouse automation contract
to purchase three Rolex watches amounting to a total sum of S$27,500.</p>
<p>11. For their actions in the alleged purchase of watches with the corrupt
payments, Alex and Ashelyn face two charges and one charge, respectively,
punishable under Section 54(5)(a) of the <em>Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (“CDSA”)</em>.</p>
<p>12. ECT Asia faces two charges punishable under Section 54(5)(b) of the <em>CDSA</em>,
for acquiring a total sum of S$101,235 which directly represents benefits
from the alleged corrupt commissions payments arising from the warehouse
automation contract. In addition, ECT Asia faces two charges punishable
under Section 54(5)(b) of the <em>CDSA</em>, for acquiring a total sum of
S$70,550 which directly represents benefits from the alleged cheating offences
arising from the marking up of the price of shuttle robots.</p>
