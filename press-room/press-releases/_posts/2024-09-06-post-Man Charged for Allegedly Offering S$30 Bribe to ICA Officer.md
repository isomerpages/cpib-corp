National) was charged in Court for allegedly offering a bribe to an Immigration
&amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officer.</p>
<p>2. On 8 August 2024, in a holding room at Changi Airport Terminal 2 Arrival
Hall, Wei was alleged to have corruptly offered a bribe of S$30 to ICA

to Singapore. No bribe offer was accepted by Insp Tai and the case was
subsequently referred to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB).
