<p>On 18 October 2024, Rakibul (“Rakibul”) (30-year-old male Bangladeshi
national), was sentenced to 1 month imprisonment for corruptly offering
bribes to two Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers.</p>
<p>2. Investigations revealed that on 2 October 2024, Rakibul arrived in
Singapore on a flight from Bangladesh. Upon reaching the Automated Lanes
at Changi Airport Terminal 2, Rakibul was stopped from entering Singapore
by the ICA system. An officer escorted Rakibul to the ICA Duty Officer
Room for further checks. Rakibul was then brought to a waiting room by
ICA Checkpoint Inspector Muhammad Firdaus bin Ahmad (“Insp Firdaus”). As
Insp Firdaus was bringing Rakibul to the waiting room, Rakibul passed him
a piece of paper with the following message: “I give you 200 Singapore
dollars inside the passport. Let me go to visit Singapore please”. Insp
Firdaus then called ICA Assistant Superintendent Wong Wei Quan (“ASP Wong”)
to the waiting room to assess the situation.</p>
<p>3. When ASP Wong attempted to clarify Rakibul’s intent in producing the
paper, Rakibul offered S$200 in cash to ASP Wong as an inducement to be
allowed entry into Singapore. The two ICA officers did not accept the bribe
offers and the case was reported to the Corrupt Practices Investigation
Bureau (“CPIB”). For his actions, Rakibul was charged in Court on 3 October
2024 for two corruption offences punishable under Section 6(b) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>.</p>
<p>4. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em> can
be fined up to S$100,000, or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years,
or both.</p>
<p>5. CPIB looks into all corruption-related complaints and reports, including <strong><u>anonymous ones</u></strong>,
