<p>The three law enforcement agencies that are directly involved in investigating
money laundering in Singapore – the Singapore Police Force (SPF), Central
Narcotics Bureau (CNB) and Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB)
– have published Singapore’s Law Enforcement Strategy to Combat Money Laundering.
This strategy document supports the National AML Strategy<sup>1</sup>,
which was also published today. It articulates the shared commitment by
law enforcement agencies to combat money laundering (ML) and addresses
the key money laundering threats identified in the 2024 ML Risk National
Assessment (NRA)<sup>2</sup>. This document is a refreshed version of the
SPF’s Anti Money Laundering (AML) Policy Statement and Strategies published
in 2016.</p>
<p>2. Singapore adopts a holistic approach to AML. This involves government
agencies, public-private partnerships, and international collaboration,
centred on the three pillars of prevention, detection, and enforcement.
The SPF, CNB and CPIB play a significant role in all three pillars.
<br>
</p>
<p>3. The law enforcement agencies have made major progress on the six strategies
in SPF’s AML Policy Statement and Strategies 2016. Singapore’s Law Enforcement
Strategy to Combat Money Laundering updates these strategies by identifying
four Focus Areas and 10 Key Actions to ensure that the law enforcement
agencies are at the forefront of AML efforts:</p>
<p><strong>Focus Area 1: Whole-of-society outreach &amp; awareness of key ML threats</strong>
</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Engage society to deter ML activities</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Share emerging risks observed with other public agencies for stronger supervision
and regulatory enforcement</p>
<p><strong>Focus Area 2: Better sensemaking across public and private stakeholders</strong>
</p>
<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Enhance the analysis and use of financial intelligence to detect ML</p>
<p>(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Promote interagency and public-private information flows and collaboration</p>
<p><strong>Focus Area 3: Enhance investigative capability for key ML threats</strong>
</p>
<p>(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure AML laws
remain up-to-date and dissuasive</p>
<p>(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build on platforms
with other competent authorities and international counterparts to detect
and investigate ML</p>
<p>(vii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leverage
digitalisation and technology for more effective investigative tools</p>
<p><strong>Focus Area 4: Strengthen asset recovery capabilities</strong>
</p>
<p>(viii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continue
to pursue criminal assets moved into and out of Singapore</p>
<p>(ix)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strengthen capabilities
in tracing and recovering virtual assets</p>
<p>(x)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure strict enforcement of the
cross-border cash reporting regime</p>
<p>4. Together with our AML stakeholders, the SPF, CNB, and CPIB will continue
our efforts to enhance our enforcement capabilities and maintain Singapore’s
reputation as a trusted financial centre and business hub. Please refer
