<p>On 22 November 2024, <strong>Ahmad Bin Khamis (“Ahmad”)</strong> (64-year-old
male Singaporean), a Senior Security Officer employed by Pico Guards Pte
Ltd at the material time, was charged in Court with alleged corruption
offences. Two other individuals, <strong>Roslan Bin Selamat (“Roslan”)</strong> (65-year-old
male Singaporean) and <strong>Theku Raja Suresh (“Theku”)</strong> (41-year-old
male Indian National), were also charged in connection with Ahmad’s offences.</p>
<p>2. Between 2019 and 2022, Ahmad is alleged to have corruptly obtained
gratifications amounting to no less than S$4,750 over 32 occasions from
Roslan, Theku, and three other individuals who are believed to be members
of a syndicate. These gratifications were meant as an inducement for Ahmad
to allow Roslan, Theku and their syndicate members to transport duty-unpaid
cigarettes past the security post at the Chevron Penjuru Terminal and into
Singapore.</p>
<p>3. For his actions, Ahmad faces 13 charges under Section 6(a) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>,
of which 10 charges are amalgamated pursuant to Section 124(4) and 124(8)
of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em>. Correspondingly, Roslan and Theku
each face four charges under Section 6(b) read with Section 29(a) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>,
of which two charges are amalgamated pursuant to Section 124(4) and 124(8)
of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em>. To combat corruption through swift
and sure, firm but fair action.</p>
<p>4. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em> can
be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years
or to both.</p>
