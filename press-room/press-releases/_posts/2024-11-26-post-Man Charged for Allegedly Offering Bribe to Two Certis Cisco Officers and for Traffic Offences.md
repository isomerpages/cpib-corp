<p>On 26 November 2024, Sellakkannu Karuppusamy (“Sellakkannu”) (32-year-old
male Indian National) was charged in Court for allegedly offering a bribe
to two Certis Cisco Auxiliary Police Officers and for committing traffic
offences.</p>
<p>2. On or around 13 June 2024, Sellakkannu was alleged to have corruptly
offered a bribe of S$150 to two Certis Cisco Auxiliary Police Officers,
Sergeant Mohamed Halim Bin Jumari and Sergeant Muhammad Mustaqim Bin Ramli
(the “two officers”), as an inducement to be released from custody. Sellakkannu
was stopped at the junction of West Coast Road and Penjuru Road for checks
by the two officers as he was observed to be driving a lorry dangerously.
The two officers rejected the bribe.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Sellakkannu was arrested by the Traffic Police for suspected drink
driving after failing the breathalyser test, and the case of his alleged
attempt to bribe the two officers was subsequently referred to the Corrupt
Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”). For his alleged action, Sellakkannu
faces one charge punishable under Section 6(b) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. In addition to the alleged corruption offence, Sellakkannu was charged
for allegedly driving a lorry without due care and attention along the
Ayer Rajah Expressway. He was also charged for allegedly driving while
under the influence of alcohol.</p>
<p></p>

<p>6. The offence of driving without due care and attention under Section
65(1)(a) punishable under Section 65(5)(a) read with Section 65(5)(c) of
the <em>Road Traffic Act 1961</em> carries a fine of not less than S$2,000
