<p>On 3 December 2024, Xu Shunbo (“Xu”) (许顺波, 42-year-old male Chinese National)
was charged in Court for allegedly offering bribes to two Singapore Police
Force (SPF) officers.</p>
<p>2. On 13 November 2024, Xu was alleged to have corruptly offered S$150
each to Senior Staff Sergent Muhammad Shammer Bin Mohamed Hassan and Sergeant
1 Kevin Vengatesh, as an inducement to not take enforcement actions against
him for littering in public. The two SPF officers rejected the bribes.
For his alleged actions, Xu faces two charges punishable under Section
6(b) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>.</p>
<p>3. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em> can
be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years
or both.</p>
