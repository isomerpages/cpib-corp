<p>On 3 December 2024, the following three individuals were charged in Court
for alleged offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act and Penal Code:</p>
<p>a) <strong>Remy bin Hashim (“Remy”)</strong> (52-year-old male Singaporean),
Lifting Superintendent of Exyte Singapore Pte Ltd (“Exyte”) at the material
time;</p>
<p>b) <strong>Kumaravail S/O Krishna (“Kumar”)</strong> (49-year-old male Singaporean),
Lifting Supervisor of Exyte at the material time; and</p>
<p>c) <strong>Abdul Rahman bin Muhammad Don (“Rahman”)</strong> (38-year-old
male Singaporean), Lifting Supervisor of Exyte at the material time.</p>
<p><em>Alleged Corruption Offences</em>
</p>
<p>2. Between May and July 2022, Remy was alleged to have corruptly obtained
gratification of S$2,000 from a subcontractor of Exyte, as an inducement
for the subcontractor to pass the lifting assessment at a project worksite.
Remy was also alleged to have later corruptly given Rahman S$300 to ensure
that the said subcontractor passed the lifting assessment. During the same
period, Remy and Rahman allegedly corruptly obtained a red packet of S$200
each, with Rahman also allegedly obtaining a bottle of Chivas Regal whiskey,
from another subcontractor of Exyte as a reward for approving the subcontractor’s
application to carry out lifting works at the project worksite. In addition,
Remy was alleged to have corruptly obtained S$600 from a third subcontractor,
as an inducement for allocating lifting resources to this subcontractor’s
company.</p>
<p>3. For their actions, Remy faces four charges punishable under Section
6(a) and 6(b) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>, while Rahman
faces two charges of corruptly accepting and obtaining gratification punishable
under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.</p>
<p><em>Alleged Misappropriation Offences</em>
</p>
<p>4. On at least six occasions between October and November 2022, Remy and
Kumar allegedly conspired with three other individuals to dishonestly convert
Exyte’s lifting machinery at a project worksite for their own use to advance
the business interests of Venki Construction and Trading Pte Ltd.</p>
<p>5. For their actions, Remy and Kumar each face one charge punishable under
Section 403 read with Section 109 of the <em>Penal Code</em>, which is amalgamated
pursuant to Section 124(4) of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em>.</p>
<p>6. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em> can
be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years
or both. Any person convicted of an offence under Section 403 of the <em>Penal Code</em> can
be sentenced to imprisonment of up to two years, or liable to a fine, or
both.</p>
