<p>On 3 December 2024, the key suspect of the Citiraya Industries Ltd (“Citiraya”)<sup>1</sup> corruption
case and his wife were nabbed in Malaysia by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption
Commission (“MACC”), and handed over to the Corrupt Practices Investigation
Bureau’s (“CPIB”) custody on the same day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. The two Singaporeans, Ng Teck Lee ("Ng") (58-year-old male), Chief
Executive Officer of Citiraya at the material time of the offence and Thor
Chwee Hwa (“Thor”) (55-year-old female), had left Singapore in 2005 when
CPIB first investigated the case. Various efforts were made by the authorities
to locate Ng in connection with CPIB’s investigations. These included the
issuance of immigration stoplist, Police Gazette, Singapore Warrant of
Arrest and International Warrant of Arrest through Interpol.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;On 4 December 2024, Ng and Thor will be charged in Court for the
following:</p>
<p></p>
<p>a)&nbsp;<em>Ng Teck Lee</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>i.&nbsp;One charge of an offence punishable under Section 408 of the <em>Penal Code, Chapter 224</em>,
for allegedly committing criminal breach of trust as a servant by dishonestly
misappropriating electronic scraps of various companies, that were entrusted
to him, to his own use. Ng instructed certain employees of Citiraya not
to crush the electronic scraps, and to repackage, and export them.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>b)&nbsp;<em>Thor Chwee Hwa</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>i. One charge of an offence under Section 44(1)(a) of the <em>Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (“CDSA”) (Chapter 65A), </em>punishable
under Section 44(5) of the <em>CDSA</em>. Thor allegedly had an arrangement
with Ng to open a Credit Suisse Hong Kong Branch account in her name, which
she had reasonable grounds to believe that the said account would be used
to retain the benefits from Ng’s criminal conduct.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4.&nbsp;CPIB investigations are currently on-going.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5.&nbsp;In expressing appreciation to the MACC, Mr Vincent Lim, Director
of Investigations at CPIB, said: “CPIB would like to thank MACC for their
strong support in rendering assistance to CPIB on this case. The successful
arrest of the two Singaporean fugitives involved in this significant corruption
case after almost two decades attests to the longstanding ties and close
cooperation between CPIB and MACC. There is zero-tolerance and no safe
haven for those who choose to break our laws by engaging in corrupt or
criminal activities. CPIB will spare no effort to track them down wherever
they may hide and bring them to face justice in Singapore.”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
