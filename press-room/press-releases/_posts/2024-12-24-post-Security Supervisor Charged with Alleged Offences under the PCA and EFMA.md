<p>On 24 December 2024, Tanayogaraj A/L Nagaraji (“Tanayogaraj”) (40-year-old
male Malaysian), a Security Supervisor with Jasa Investigation &amp; Security
Services Pte Ltd at the material time, was charged in Court with alleged
offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act 1960 and the Employment
of Foreign Manpower Act 1990.</p>
<p>2. On or about 22 November 2024, Tanayogaraj was alleged to have corruptly
obtained S$29 in gratification from a resident of a dormitory. The gratification
was meant as an inducement for not reporting the said resident for bringing
a contraband cigarette into the dormitory. In addition, Tanayogaraj was
also alleged to have in his possession, without lawful authority, a work
pass which was issued to the said resident.</p>
<p>3. For his actions, Tanayogaraj faces one charge for an offence punishable
under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1960, and one charge
under Section 22(1)(f) and punishable under Section 22(1)(i) of the Employment
of Foreign Manpower Act 1990.</p>
<p>4. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the Prevention
of Corruption Act 1960 can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment
of up to five years or both. Any person convicted of an offence punishable
under Section 22(1)(i) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act 1990 can
be fined up to S$20,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to two years
or both.</p>
