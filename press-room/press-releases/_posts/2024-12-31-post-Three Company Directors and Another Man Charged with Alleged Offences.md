<p>On 31 December 2024, the following four individuals were charged in Court
with various alleged offences under the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>,
the <em>Penal Code</em> and the <em>Arms and Explosive Act</em>:</p>
<p>a) Mohamad Daud Bin A Rahim (“Daud”) (60-year-old male Singaporean), Director
of Qirom Consulting Pte Ltd (“Qirom Consulting”) at the material time;</p>
<p>b) Mohd Nasir Bin Mohd Sairi (“Nasir”) (59-year-old male Singaporean),
Director of Fatiin Multimedia Pte Ltd (“Fatiin Multimedia”) at the material
time;</p>
<p>c) Mohd Nasral Bin Awang (“Nasral”) (44-year-old male Malaysian), Director
of Onaga Sys Pte Ltd (“Onaga Sys”) at the material time; and</p>
<p>d) Mohd Zairil Bin Ismail (“Zairil”) (53-year-old male Singaporean), a
Senior Manager with the Mosque-Madrasah-Wakaf Shared Services (MMWSS) at
the material time.</p>
<p><strong>Alleged Offences in relation to Fictitious Quotations</strong>
</p>
<p>2. On two occasions between August and October 2022, Daud allegedly instigated
Nasir and Nasral to prepare and issue fictitious quotations from Fatiin
Multimedia and Onaga Sys for the amount of S$24,900 and S$56,000 respectively.
These quotations were to be submitted to the Sultan Mosque as support quotes
for the Sultan Mosque’s digitalisation project.</p>
<p>3. Then, between September and October 2022, Daud was alleged to have
knowingly given these two fictitious quotations to a Finance &amp; Human
Resource Manager of the Sultan Mosque. These fictitious quotations were
allegedly intended to mislead the Sultan Mosque into believing that Fatiin
Multimedia and Onaga Sys were prepared to undertake the digitalisation
project for the Sultan Mosque at the quoted prices. Daud allegedly intended
to deceive the Sultan Mosque into believing that Qirom Consulting, who
also submitted a quotation for the digitalisation project, had submitted
a quotation that was competitive.</p>
<p>4. For their actions, Daud, Nasir and Nasral faced charges for offences
punishable under Section 477A read with Section 109 of the <em>Penal Code</em>.
Daud also faced additional charges for offences punishable under Section
6(c) of <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Alleged Offence in relation to Giving False Information to a Public Servant and Possession of a Prohibited Item</strong>
</p>
<p>5. On or about 16 June 2023, in Singapore, Zairil was the subject of an
internal Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) investigation. In the course
of the investigation, Zairil allegedly gave false information to a Deputy
Director of MUIS by stating that he did not have any personal or financial
interest in Qirom Consulting and that he had never received any payment
from Qirom Consulting. Zairil knew this information was false. Zairil knew
that by giving false information to the Deputy Director of MUIS, it would
likely cause the said Deputy Director of MUIS to omit further investigations
into his interest in Qirom Consulting and any payments he had received
from Qirom Consulting. For this, Zairil has been charged with committing
an offence punishable under Section 182 of the <em>Penal Code</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Alleged Offence in relation to Possession of a Prohibited Item</strong>
</p>
<p>6. On or about 5 September 2023, Zairil was allegedly found to having
a pepper spray under his control. Zairil did not have a prescribed license
to have a pepper spray under his control. This constitutes an offence under
Section 13(1)(a) of the <em>Arms and Explosive Act</em>, punishable under
Section 13(4) of the same act.</p>
<p>7. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act </em>can
be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years
or both. Any person convicted of an offence punishable under Section 477A
of the <em>Penal Code</em>, can be fined or sentenced to imprisonment of
up to 10 years or both. Any person convicted of an offence punishable under
Section 182 of the <em>Penal Code</em> can be fined or sentenced to imprisonment
of up to 2 years or both. Any person convicted of an offence punishable
under Section 13(4) of the <em>Arms and Explosive Act</em> can be fined up
to S$5,000 and sentenced to imprisonment of up to 3 years.</p>
