<p>On 9 January 2025, <strong>Sun Song (“Sun”)</strong> (孙嵩, 29-year-old female
Chinese National) was charged in Court for allegedly offering a bribe to
an Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officer.</p>
<p>2. On or about 23 November 2024 at Woodlands Checkpoint, Sun was alleged
to have corruptly offered a bribe of S$50 to ICA Sergeant Nurliana Binte
Mohamad Sufian (“Sgt Nurliana”), as an inducement to not take enforcement
action against her for failing to declare duty-unpaid cigarettes in her
possession upon arrival into Singapore. No bribe offer was accepted by
Sgt Nurliana and the case was subsequently referred to the Corrupt Practices
Investigation Bureau (CPIB). For her alleged action, Sun faces one charge
punishable under Section 6(b) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>.</p>
<p>3. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em> can
be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years
or both.</p>
