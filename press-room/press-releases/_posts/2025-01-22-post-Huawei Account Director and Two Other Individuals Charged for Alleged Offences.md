<p>On 22 January 2025, the following three individuals were charged in Court
for alleged offences under the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act </em>and <em>Penal Code</em>:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Peng Ming</strong> (“Peng”) (彭明, 39-year-old
male Singaporean), Account Director at Huawei International Pte Ltd (“Huawei”)
at the material time;</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Ng Kah Siang</strong> (“Ng”) (黄家祥, 37-year-old
male Singaporean), Engineer at Integrated Health Systems Information Pte
Ltd (“IHiS”) at the material time; and</p>
<p>c) <strong>Chiang Chee Seng</strong> (“Chiang”) (蔣志成, 50-year-old male Singaporean),
Senior Sales Director at Nera Telecommunications Ltd (“Nera”) at the material
time.</p>
<p>2. In November 2021, Ng allegedly corruptly attempted to obtain gratification
of a sum of S$20,000 from Peng as an inducement to advance the business
interests of Huawei with IHiS. Ng also allegedly corruptly attempted to
obtain gratification of 1% of a vendor’s sales revenue and no less than
S$20,000 from a second vendor, as inducements to advance the vendors’ business
with IHiS.</p>
<p>3. In February 2022, Peng allegedly deceived Huawei into believing that
Ng and Ng’s wife were directors of IHiS, so as to intentionally induce
Huawei to approve a sponsored overseas trip to Paris for them. From 11
to 20 March 2022, Peng and Chiang allegedly conspired to corruptly give
Ng and his wife gratification in the form of the said overseas trip, valued
at around S$18,265, as an inducement to advance the business interests
of Huawei and Nera with IHiS. Ng also allegedly corruptly attempted to
obtain gratification of 1% of Nera’s sales revenue from Chiang on a separate
occasion to further advance the business interests of Nera with IHiS.</p>
<p>4. On several occasions between 2020 to 2022, Peng had also allegedly
corruptly given gratification of about S$300 for each occasion in the form
of entertainment to an engineer employed with IHiS, as an inducement to
advance the business interests of Huawei with IHiS.</p>
<p>5. For their actions, Peng and Chiang each face one charge for offences
under Section 6(b) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em> read with
Section 29(a) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>. Peng faces an
additional three charges under section 6(b) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>,
amalgamated under Section 124(4) and punishable under Section 124(8)(a)(ii)
of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em>, and one additional charge for offences
under Section 417 of the <em>Penal Code</em>. Ng faces five charges under
Section 6(a) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>.</p>
<p>6. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act </em>can
be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years
or both. Any person convicted of an offence under Section 124(8)(a)(ii)
of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 can face two times the amount of punishment
liable for that offence. Any person who is convicted of a cheating offence
under Section 417 of the <em>Penal Code</em> shall be punished with imprisonment
for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.</p>
<p>7. Organisations are strongly advised to put in place robust procedures,
in areas such as procurement and internal audit, to prevent falling victim
to corrupt acts by their employees. Guidance for organisations on measures
