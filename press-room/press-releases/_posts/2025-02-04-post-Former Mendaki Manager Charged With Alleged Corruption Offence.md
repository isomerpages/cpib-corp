<p>On 4 February 2025, Zulkifli Bin Kader (“Zulkifli”) (a 51-year-old male
Malaysian and Singapore Permanent Resident), a Digital Information Technology
Manager of Yayasan Mendaki (“Mendaki”) at the material time, was charged
in Court for alleged corruption.</p>
<p>2. On three occasions between April and May 2023, Zulkifli is alleged
to have attempted to obtain one Lenovo ThinkPad T14 laptop valued at a
sum of at least S$1,061.61, from an employee of A-Speed Pte Ltd (“A-Speed”),
as a reward for accepting A-Speed’s tender for works linked to Mendaki.
For his alleged attempts to obtain gratification, Zulkifli faces one charge
for an offence under Section 6(a) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em> read
with Section 124(4) and punishable under Section 124(8)(a)(ii) of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em>.</p>
<p>3. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act </em>can
be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years
or both. Any person convicted of an offence under Section 124(8)(a)(ii)
of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code </em>can face two times the amount of
punishment liable for that offence.</p>
