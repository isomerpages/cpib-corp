<p>The 2024 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index (TI-CPI)
has ranked Singapore the 3rd least corrupt country in the world out of
180 countries with a score of 84. Singapore improved by 2 rank positions
and 1 score point from the 2023 TI-CPI. This is Singapore’s highest position
since 2020 and the first time since 2010 that Singapore is top in the Asia
Pacific region.</p>
<p>2. The TI-CPI ranks and measures countries by their perceived levels of
public sector corruption. The 2024 index draws upon 13 expert assessments
and business surveys. Countries are then scored on a scale of zero, for
highly corrupt, to 100, for very clean.</p>
<p>3. The corruption situation in Singapore remains firmly under control.
In the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index 2024, Singapore was ranked
3rd for absence of corruption, the top Asian nation out of 142 countries.
The Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) continues to rank Singapore
first as the least corrupt country in its 2024 Report on Corruption in
Asia, the US and Australia out of 16 economies, a position we have held
since 1995. Domestically, the number of public sector corruption cases
remain consistently low.</p>
<p>4. Singapore’s reputation as one of the least corrupt countries in the
world is hard-earned. Our people continue to hold a strong stance against
corruption, and will come forward to report wrongdoings to the authorities.
CPIB studies all reports and information that may disclose a corruption
offence seriously, whether the informant is known or anonymous. CPIB is
grateful to the public for their trust and support and remains resolute
in keeping our home corruption-free.</p>
