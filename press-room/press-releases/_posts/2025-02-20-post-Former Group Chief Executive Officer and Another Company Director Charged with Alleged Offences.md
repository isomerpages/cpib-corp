<p>On 20 February 2025, two individuals were charged in Court for alleged
offences under the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act (Chapter 241) (“PCA”)</em>,
the <em>Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Chapter 65A) (“CDSA”)</em>,
and the <em>Companies Act (Chapter 50) (“CA”)</em>. They are:</p>
<p>a) <strong>Ng Woei Kiat (“Ng”) </strong>(黄伟杰, 51-year-old male Singaporean),
Group Chief Executive Officer of Apollo Aquaculture Group Pte Ltd (“AAG”)
and a member of AAG’s Board of Directors at the material time of the offences;
and</p>
<p>b) <strong>Koh Joon Seong Alan (“Alan”)</strong> (许俊雄, 51-year-old male
Singaporean), a Director of Alric Projects Pte Ltd and Alric MEP Engineering
Pte Ltd (collectively, the “Alric Companies”) at the material time of the
offences.</p>
<p><em>Alleged Offences under the PCA and CDSA</em>
</p>
<p>2. On 24 August 2018, Ng allegedly obtained a bribe of S$450,000 from
Alan. The bribe was meant as an inducement for not showing disfavour to
the Alric Companies in their dealings with AAG. Subsequently, on 27 August
2018, Ng was alleged to have used the bribe money to make a partial downpayment
of S$471,000 for a private condominium unit.</p>
<p>3. For his actions, Ng faces one charge for an offence punishable under
Section 6(a) of the <em>PCA</em>, and one charge for an offence under Section
47(1)(c) of the <em>CDSA </em>and punishable under Section 47(6)(a) of the <em>CDSA</em>.
Correspondingly, Alan faces one charge for an offence punishable under
Section 6(b) of the <em>PCA</em>.</p>
<p><em>Alleged Offences under the CA</em>
</p>
<p>4. Separately, Ng will also face seven charges punishable under Section
156(1) read with Section 156(15) of the <em>CA </em>for alleged failures
to declare his interest in related-party transactions to AAG’s Board of
Directors.</p>
<p>5. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the <em>PCA </em>can
be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years
or both. Any person convicted of an offence punishable under Section 47(6)(a)
of the <em>CDSA </em>can be fined up to S$500,000 or sentenced to imprisonment
of up to 10 years or both. Any person convicted of an offence under Section
156(1) read with Section 156(15) of the <em>CA </em>can be fined up to S$5,000
or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 12 months.</p>
