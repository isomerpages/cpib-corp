<p>On 26 March 2025, the following two individuals were charged in Court
for alleged offences under the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>:</p>
<p>a) <strong>Goh Jong Lih </strong>(“Goh”) (吴鎔利, 61-year-old female Singaporean),
Operations Manager at St Anthony’s Canossian Secondary School (“SACSS”)
at the material time; and</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Loo Wei Kiat</strong> (“Loo”) (吕炜杰, 45-year-old
male Singaporean), Director of Advent Solutions &amp; Projects Pte Ltd
(“AS&amp;P”) at the material time.</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On six occasions
between February 2020 and December 2021, Goh allegedly obtained bribes
in the form of loans totalling S$9,500 from Loo, as inducements to advance
AS&amp;P’s business interests with SACSS. On multiple occasions between
2017 to 2021, Loo allegedly gave documents issued by various contractors
and himself to Goh who then used them to deceive and mislead SACSS.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For their actions,
Goh faces six charges for offences punishable under Section 6(a) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>.
Goh also faces 17 charges for offences punishable under Section 6(c) of
the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act, </em>of which 10 charges are amalgamated
under Section 124(4) read with Section 124(8)(a)(ii) of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em>.
Loo faces six charges for offences punishable under Section 6(b) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>.
Loo also faces 14 charges for offences punishable under Section 6(c) of
the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act,</em> of which 7 charges are amalgamated
under Section 124(4) read with Section 124(8)(a)(ii) of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em>.</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore adopts
a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person convicted
of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the&nbsp;<em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>&nbsp;can
be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years
or both. Any person convicted of an offence amalgamated under Section 124(4)
read with Section 124(8)(a)(ii) of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em> can
face two times the amount of punishment liable for that offence.</p>
