<p>On 17 April 2025, <strong>Huang Qiulin</strong> (“Huang”) (黄秋林, 41-year-old
male Chinese National) was charged in Court for allegedly offering a bribe
to a National Environment Agency (NEA) enforcement officer.</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 26 March 2025,
Huang allegedly gave a bribe of S$50 to NEA enforcement officer Tan Tar
Chuak (“Officer Tan”), as an inducement to Officer Tan and two of his colleagues
to refrain from taking enforcement action against Huang for smoking in
a non-designated smoking area outside a shopping centre along Orchard Road.
The NEA officer rejected the bribe. For his alleged action, Huang faces
one charge punishable under Section 6(b) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>.
Huang was on holiday in Singapore at that point in time.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore adopts
a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person convicted
of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em> can
be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years
or both.</p>
