<p>On 9 May 2025, <strong>Huang Binghao</strong> (“Huang”) (黄炳浩, 34-year-old
male Chinese National) was charged in Court for allegedly offering bribes
to two Certis Cisco Auxiliary Police Officers (APOs).</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 10 April 2025,
on separate occasions, Huang allegedly offered a bribe of S$50 each to
two Certis Cisco APOs attached to the National Environment Agency (NEA),
Koh Jun Song and Maikal Selvarai, as an inducement to refrain from taking
enforcement action against him. Huang was smoking in a non-designated smoking
area outside the vicinity of Tang Plaza along Orchard Road. The two Certis
Cisco APOs rejected the bribes, and the case was subsequently referred
to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). For his alleged actions,
Huang faces two charges punishable under section 6(b) of the<em> Prevention of Corruption Act</em>.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore adopts
a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person convicted
of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em> can
be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years
or both.</p>
