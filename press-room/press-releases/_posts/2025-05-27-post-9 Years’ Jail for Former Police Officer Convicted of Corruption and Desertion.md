<p>On 26 May 2025, <strong>Koh Kian Tiong</strong>  <strong>(“Koh”)</strong> (许建忠,
52-year-old male Singaporean), a former Assistant Superintendent of Police,
was sentenced to 9 years’ jail for corruptly obtaining gratification, failing
to comply with the lawful demands of Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau
(“CPIB”) officers, and desertion from the Singapore Police Force (“SPF”).
He was also ordered to pay a fine of S$1,000 and a penalty of S$47,700,
and he will be imprisoned for an additional 54 days if he fails to pay
the amount.</p>
<p>2. Investigations revealed that in 2005, while Koh was attached to the
Secret Societies Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department (“CID”),
he became acquainted with Chua Chin Hoe (“Chua”), the boss of a gambling
syndicate. At the time, Chua operated illegal internet gambling dens across
Singapore. Koh began meeting Chua frequently for drinks and entertainment
at various KTV outlets and pubs.</p>
<p>3. Over several occasions between 2006 and 2007, Koh (who was then attached
to the Anti-Unlicensed Moneylending Task Force in the CID) obtained several
gratifications from Chua as follows:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sum of S$15,000 which Koh needed to pay for the
legal bills arising from his divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sum of S$6,000.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sum of S$25,500 to clear Koh’s credit card
bills.</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Koh’s air tickets to Shanghai and hotel room charges
amounting to S$1,200.</p>
<p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drinks at a KTV establishment and a disco pub where
Chua paid an unspecified sum for a bottle of “Martell” and four bottles
of “Johnny Walker” whiskey as a treat to Koh.</p>
<p>4. Koh had invited several colleagues and subordinate Police officers
along on some of the occasions when he and Chua went for drinks and introduced
them to Chua. By doing this, Koh exposed these officers to cultivation
by Chua.</p>
<p>5. When CPIB conducted its investigations into Koh in July 2007, he was
on vacation leave in Shanghai. However, Koh did not return to Singapore
following the expiry of his vacation leave and despite repeated requests
from CPIB to do so. CPIB subsequently made an application for an Interpol
Red Notice against Koh in March 2008 and continued in its efforts to locate
Koh overseas. In August 2019, with the assistance of the SPF, CPIB learned
that Koh had been arrested by authorities in the People’s Republic of China
(“PRC”). He was subsequently investigated and convicted for criminal offences
committed in the PRC. Koh was repatriated to Singapore on 28 April 2024
after serving his sentence in the PRC, and CPIB resumed its investigations.</p>
<p>6. In total, Koh had accepted and obtained at least S$47,700 worth of
bribes from Chua. Chua had agreed to provide the gratifications out of
fear that Koh might make it difficult for him to operate his gambling business
or that he might be reported to the Gambling Suppression Branch in the
CID. In exchange, Koh provided Chua with information about CID operations
that might affect Chua’s gambling businesses.</p>
<p>7. Koh was charged on 29 April 2024 with 14 counts of corruption under
Section 6(a) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act,</em> and one count
of failing to comply with the lawful demands of CPIB officers in the execution
of their duty under Section 26(c) read with Section 37(1) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>.
He was also charged with one count of desertion under Section 34(1) of
the <em>Police Force Act </em>for failing to report to work following the
expiry of his vacation leave. Chua was previously sentenced in 2012 to
four-and-a-half years’ jail and fined S$20,000 for offences under the&nbsp;<em>Prevention of Corruption Act&nbsp;</em>and
the&nbsp;<em>Common Gaming House Act</em>.</p>
<p>8. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6(a) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act </em>can
be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to an imprisonment term of up to
five years or both. Any person convicted of an offence punishable under
Section 26(c) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act </em>can be fined
up to S$10,000 or sentenced to an imprisonment term of up to one year or
both. Any person convicted of an offence under Section 34(1) of the <em>Police Force Act </em>can
be fined up to S$5,000 and sentenced to an imprisonment term of up to 10
years.</p>
