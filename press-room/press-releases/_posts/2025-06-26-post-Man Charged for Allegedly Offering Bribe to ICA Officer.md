<p>On 26 June 2025, <strong>Du Bochuan (“Du”)</strong> (杜博川, 41-year-old male
Chinese National) was charged in Court for allegedly offering a bribe to
an Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (“ICA”) officer.</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 6 June 2025,
Du allegedly offered a bribe of S$1,000 to an ICA Checkpoint Inspector
Seah Zhen Hui (“Inspector Seah”), as an inducement for Inspector Seah to
facilitate Du’s entry into Singapore after Du was denied entry at Singapore
Changi Airport. Inspector Seah rejected the bribe. For his alleged action,
Du faces one charge punishable under Section 6(b) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore adopts
a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption. Any person convicted
of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em> can
be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment not exceeding five
years or to both.</p>
