<p>On 10 July 2025, <strong>Xu Manye (“Xu”)</strong> (许漫烨, 37-year-old male
Chinese National) was charged in Court for allegedly offering bribes to
two Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) officers.</p>
<p>2. On 24 March 2025, on three separate occasions, Xu allegedly offered
a bribe of S$50 to two LTA officers, Tay Boon Tat Francis and Lim Ghim
Wee, as an inducement to treat him favourably in relation to the outcome
of LTA’s investigations of his personal mobile device (PMD), and for the
return of his PMD. Xu’s device had been impounded by LTA after failing
to meet the stipulated safety standards during an inspection. The two LTA
officers rejected the bribes, and the case was subsequently referred to
the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). For his alleged actions,
Xu faces three charges punishable under section 6(b) of the Prevention
of Corruption Act.</p>
<p>3. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the Prevention
of Corruption Act can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment
