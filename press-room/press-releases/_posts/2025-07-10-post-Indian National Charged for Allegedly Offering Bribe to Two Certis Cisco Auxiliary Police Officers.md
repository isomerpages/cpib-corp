<p>On 10 July 2025, <strong>Krishnan Ramakrishnan (“Krishnan”)</strong> (30-year-old
male Indian National) was charged in Court for allegedly offering a bribe
to two Certis Cisco Auxiliary Police Officers (APOs).</p>
<p>2. On 18 April 2025, Krishnan allegedly offered a bribe of S$100 to two
Certis Cisco APOs attached to the National Environment Agency (NEA), Sri
Suthan Sellah and Sugeerta B Kalaivanan, as an inducement to waive the
enforcement action taken against him for littering. The two Certis Cisco
APOs rejected the bribe, and the case was subsequently referred to the
Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). For his alleged action,
Krishnan faces one charge punishable under section 6(b) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>.</p>
<p>3. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em> can
be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment not exceeding five
years or to both.</p>
