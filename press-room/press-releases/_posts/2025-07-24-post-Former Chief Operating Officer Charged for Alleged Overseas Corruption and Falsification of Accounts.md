<p>On 24 July 2025, <strong>Hooi Siew Yan</strong> (“Hooi”) (68-year-old male
Singaporean), was charged in Court for allegedly committing overseas corruption
and falsification of accounts offences. Hooi was the Managing Director
of MJI Universal Pte Ltd (“MJI”) from July 2007 to November 2019, and its
Chief Operating Officer from November 2019 to November 2022.</p>
<p><em>Alleged overseas corruption offences</em>
</p>
<p>2<em>. </em>Between 2019 and 2020, on 8 to 10 occasions in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, Hooi allegedly gave bribes in the form of cash amounting to at
least USD$100,000 to a procurement manager of a Malaysian company, through
a middleman, as a reward to further the business interest between MJI and
the Malaysian company. For his actions, Hooi faces a corruption charge
for an offence punishable under Section 6(b) read with Section 37(1) of
the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>, which is amalgamated pursuant
to Section 124(4) punishable under Section 124(8)(a)(ii) of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em>.</p>
<p><em>Alleged falsification of accounts offences</em>
</p>
<p>3. Between December 2020 and July 2022, Hooi allegedly conspired with
two other MJI employees with the intent to defraud MJI by instigating the
middleman to submit 35 invoices to MJI with inflated payments amounting
to about USD$72,500 when a lesser sum was due to MJI. For his actions,
Hooi faces two charges for offences punishable under Section 477A read
with Section 109 of the <em>Penal Code</em>, which are amalgamated pursuant
to Section 124(4) punishable under Section 124(8)(a)(ii) of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em>.</p>
<p>4. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em> (“PCA”)
can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment not exceeding
five years or to both. Under Section 37(1) of the <em>PCA</em>, where a
Singapore citizen commits a corruption offence outside of Singapore, he
may be dealt with as if that offence had been committed within Singapore.
Any person convicted of an offence under Section 477A of the <em>Penal Code</em> can
be fined or sentenced to imprisonment of up to 10 years or both. Any person
convicted of an offence amalgamated under Section 124(4) read with Section
124(8)(a)(ii) of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em> can face twice the
amount of punishment liable for that offence.</p>
