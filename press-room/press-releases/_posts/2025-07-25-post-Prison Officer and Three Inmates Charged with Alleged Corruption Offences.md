<p>On 25 July 2025, <strong>Mohammad Asri Bin Abd Rahim (“Asri”) </strong>(39-year-old
male Singaporean), a Prison Officer with the Singapore Prison Service at
the material time, was charged in Court with alleged corruption offences.
Three inmates were also charged in connection with Asri’s alleged offences.
They are:</p>
<p>a) <strong>Mohamad Yusof Bin Kasim (“Yusof”) </strong>(50-year-old male,
Singaporean);</p>
<p>b) <strong>Ang Wilson (“Ang”) </strong>(洪偉宏, 37-year-old male, Singaporean);
and</p>
<p>c) <strong>Murali S/O Vigneshwaran (“Murali”) </strong>(36-year-old male,
Singaporean).</p>
<p>2. Over seven occasions between August 2021 to June 2022, Asri allegedly
accepted bribes amounting to S$3,700 from Yusof as an inducement to smuggle
prohibited items into Changi Prison. These prohibited items included magazines,
nude photographs and prescription drugs. Ang and Murali allegedly aided
Yusof to give the said bribes to Asri on a few of these occasions.</p>
<p>3. For his alleged actions, Asri faces five charges for offences punishable
under Section 6(a) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>, of which
one charge is an amalgamated charge pursuant to Section 124(4) of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em>.
Correspondingly, Yusof faces five charges for offences punishable under
Section 6(b) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>, of which three
charges are read with Section 29(a) of the said act. Ang and Murali each
face one charge for an offence punishable under Section 6(b) read with
Section 29(a) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>. Murali’s charge
is an amalgamated charge pursuant to Section 124(4) of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em>.</p>
<p>4 Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the&nbsp;<em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>&nbsp;can
be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment not exceeding five
years or to both.</p>
