<p>On 19 August 2025, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) arrested
nine individuals suspected to be involved in fixing basketball matches
in the 2025 K. Star National Basketball League Division 1. These individuals
(eight Singaporeans and one Permanent Resident) are aged between 19 and
35 years old. Some of them are players from the basketball teams taking
part in the competition. One of the alleged fixed matches was a match between
Tagawa and Tong Whye which took place on 1 August 2025.</p>
<p>2. Investigations are ongoing against the arrested persons for suspected
offences under the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>.</p>
<p>3. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption,
and match-fixing of any form is not condoned in Singapore. CPIB will not
hesitate to take firm enforcement action against any parties involved,
if they have given, received, or offered bribes to fix a match.</p>
