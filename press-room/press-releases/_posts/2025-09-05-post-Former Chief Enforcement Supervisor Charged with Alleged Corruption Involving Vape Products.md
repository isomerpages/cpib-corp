<p>On 5 September 2025, Michael Anthony Pillay (“Pillay”) (34-year-old male
Singaporean), a Chief Enforcement Supervisor of WSH Experts Pte Ltd (“WSH”)
at the material time of the offence, was charged in Court for an offence
under the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>. WSH was authorised under
the <em>Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale Act) 1993</em> to carry
out enforcement duties for the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”).</p>
<p>2. Sometime in 2024, on multiple occasions, Pillay allegedly attempted
to obtain bribes amounting to S$8,000 from one Chua Wee Ming (“Chua”),
as an inducement to provide Chua with exclusive information about raids
conducted by HSA involving vape products. For his alleged action, Pillay
faces one charge punishable under Section 6(a) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em> which
is amalgamated pursuant to Section 124(4) of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em> and
liable for enhanced punishment under Section 124(8)(a)(ii) of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em>.</p>
<p>3. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the<em> Prevention of Corruption Act</em> can
be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment not exceeding five
years or to both. Any person convicted of an amalgamated charge punishable
under Section 124(8)(a)(ii) of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em> can face
twice the amount of punishment liable for that offence.</p>
