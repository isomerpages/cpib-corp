<p>On 18 September 2025, Arya Monu (“Monu”) (29-year-old male Indian National)
and Bharat (22-year-old male Indian National) were charged in Court for
alleged offences under the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>.</p>
<p>2. On 24 December 2022 and 18 February 2023, Monu and Bharat, respectively,
allegedly gave bribes in the form of sexual acts to Kannan S/O Morice Rajagopal
Jayaram (“Kannan”) (55-year-old male Singaporean), an Inspector of the
Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (“ICA”) at the material time. These
bribes were intended as an inducement for Kannan to help Monu and Bharat
with their short-term visit pass applications with the ICA. For their alleged
actions, Monu and Bharat each face one charge punishable under Section
6(b) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>.</p>
<p>3. On 11 September 2025, Kannan was sentenced to 22 months’ imprisonment
for receiving sexual favours from six foreigners to help with their short-term
visit pass applications with ICA.</p>
<p>4. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em> can

years or to both.</p>
