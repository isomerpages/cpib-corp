<p>On 16 October 2025, two individuals were charged in Court with alleged
cheating offences:</p>
<p>a) <strong>Muhammad Zahid Bin Rosli (“Zahid”) </strong>(41-year-old male
Singaporean), a Singapore Civil Defence Force (“SCDF”) officer posted to
the Civil Defence Academy at the material time of the offences; and</p>
<p>b) <strong>Nuraifa Binte Ahmad (“Nuraifa”)</strong> (38-year-old female
Singaporean), Sole Proprietor of Grundy Wellness Network (“Grundy”) and
Director of Clutch Esports Pte. Ltd. (“Clutch”) at the material time of
the offences.</p>
<p><strong><em>Alleged cheating offences involving Muhammad Zahid Bin Rosli (“Zahid”) and Nuraifa Binte Ahmad (“Nuraifa”) relating to the Singapore Civil Defence Force (“SCDF”)</em></strong>
</p>
<p>2. Between 2017 and 2023, Zahid allegedly cheated the SCDF of about S$52,000
by dishonestly concealing his personal interest in Grundy and Clutch when
he submitted quotations from both companies to the SCDF on separate occasions
for different paintball and Esports events. It is alleged that Nuraifa
intentionally aided Zahid to cheat the SCDF by uploading invoices from
Grundy and Clutch in the Government Electronic Business (“GeBIZ”) Portal
so that the companies would receive payment for organising the respective
events.</p>
<p>3. For his alleged actions, Zahid faces 16 charges under Section 420 of
the <em>Penal Code</em>. For her alleged actions, Nuraifa faces 16 charges
under Section 420 read with Section 109 of the <em>Penal Code</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Alleged cheating offences involving Muhammad Zahid Bin Rosli (“Zahid”) and Nuraifa Binte Ahmad (“Nuraifa”) relating to the Ministry of Home Affairs (“MHA”)</em></strong>
</p>
<p>4. Between 2018 and 2023, Zahid allegedly cheated the MHA of about S$80,000
by dishonestly concealing his personal interest in Grundy and Clutch when
he submitted quotations from both companies to the MHA on separate occasions
for different paintball and Esports events.</p>
<p>5. Additionally, on 14 December 2023, Zahid allegedly attempted to cheat
the MHA of about S$37,000 by dishonestly concealing his personal interest
in Clutch when he submitted a quotation from Clutch to the MHA for an Esports
event.</p>
<p>6. On 20 August 2021 and 30 November 2022, it is alleged that Nuraifa
intentionally aided Zahid to cheat the MHA of about S$33,400 by appending
her signature as the Programme Director of Grundy on the Invitation to
Quote (“ITQ”) for two Esports events to conceal Zahid's personal interest
in Grundy during the approval process. This was done to induce the MHA
to approve Grundy and Clutch’s quotations on the two separate occasions.</p>
<p>7. For his alleged actions, Zahid faces 12 charges under Section 420 of
the <em>Penal Code</em>, of which one is punishable under Section 512(2)
of the <em>Penal Code</em>. For her alleged actions, Nuraifa faces two charges
under Section 420 read with Section 109 of the <em>Penal Code</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other alleged cheating offences involving Nuraifa Binte Ahmad (“Nuraifa”) relating to the Singapore Civil Defence Force (“SCDF”) and the Ministry of Home Affairs (“MHA”)</em></strong>
</p>
<p>8. On 21 March 2022, it is alleged that Nuraifa intentionally aided Zahid
to cheat the SCDF and the MHA of about S$27,000 by incorporating Clutch
and agreeing to be its Director to conceal Zahid's personal interest in
Clutch when he submitted quotations to the SCDF and the MHA through Clutch.
This was done to induce the SCDF and the MHA to approve Clutch's quotations
on multiple occasions. For her alleged actions, Nuraifa faces one charge
under Section 420 read with Section 109 of the <em>Penal Code</em>.</p>
