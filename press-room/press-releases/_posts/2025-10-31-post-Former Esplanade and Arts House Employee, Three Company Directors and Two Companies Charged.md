<p>On 31 October 2025, the following four individuals and two companies were
charged in Court with alleged corruption offences. They are:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;<strong>Saburulla S/O Abdul Gani</strong>  <strong>(“Saburulla”)</strong> (59-year-old
male Singaporean), an employee of the Arts House Limited (“AHL”) and The
Esplanade Co Ltd (“TECL”) at the material time of the offences;</p>
<p>b) <strong>Chew Kim Kee (“Chew”)</strong> (52-year-old female Singaporean),
a Director of Aceproject Construction Pte Ltd at the material time of the
offences;</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;<strong>Eng Kim Hai (“Eng”)</strong> (黄金海, 63-year-old male Singaporean),
a Director of Aceproject Construction Pte Ltd at the material time of the
offences;</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;<strong>Yeoh Wee Yeong (“Yeoh”)</strong> (姚偉雄, 63-year-old male
Singaporean), a Director of JYD Design Pte Ltd at the material time of
the offences;</p>
<p>e)&nbsp;<strong>JYD Design Pte Ltd (“JYD”)</strong>; and</p>
<p>f)&nbsp;<strong>Aceproject Construction Pte Ltd (“Aceproject”)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Alleged Corruption Offences Involving Saburulla, Yeoh and JYD</em></strong>
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Sometime in 2005, Saburulla allegedly obtained a bribe of at least
S$1,000 from Yeoh as an inducement to not find fault with works done by
JYD. Between January 2011 and September 2022, over multiple occasions,
Saburulla allegedly obtained bribes totalling about $52,800 from Yeoh.
These bribes were rewards to advance the business interests in matters
relating to various renovation and installation contracts between JYD and
TECL or AHL.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 2009 and 2015, over separate occasions, Saburulla
allegedly conspired with Yeoh and five other individuals to mislead TECL
into believing that JYD had provided the lowest quotations, which resulted
in various renovation and building contracts being awarded to JYD. This
came in the form of multiple quotations containing false statements by
other companies which had no genuine intention to bid for the contracts.</p>
<p><strong><em>Alleged Corruption Offences Involving Saburulla, Chew, Eng and Aceproject</em></strong>
</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Between 2018 and 2022, over separate occasions, Saburulla allegedly
obtained bribes totalling about $42,800 from Chew and Eng. These were either
rewards or inducements to advance business interests in matters relating
to various renovation contracts between Aceproject and AHL.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;During the same period, over separate occasions, Saburulla allegedly
conspired with Chew and two other individuals to mislead AHL into believing
that Aceproject had provided the lowest quotations, which resulted in various
building contracts being awarded to Aceproject. This came in the form of
multiple quotations containing false statements by other companies which
had no genuine intention to bid for the contracts.</p>
<p><strong><em>Additional Alleged Corruption Offences by Saburulla</em></strong>
</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;Between 2019 and 2022, over multiple occasions, Saburulla allegedly
misled AHL into believing that Aceproject and/or JYD had provided the lowest
quotations which resulted in various contracts being awarded to Aceproject
and/or JYD. This came in the form of multiple quotations containing false
statements by another company which had no genuine intention to bid for
the contracts.</p>

<p>8.&nbsp;Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em> can
be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment not exceeding five
years or to both. The maximum imprisonment term for each offence of corruption
can be increased to 7 years if it is in relation to a matter or contract
with the Government or public body, or a subcontract to execute work comprised
in such contract. Any person convicted of an amalgamated charge punishable
under Section 124(8)(a)(ii) of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em> can face
twice the amount of punishment liable for that offence.</p>
