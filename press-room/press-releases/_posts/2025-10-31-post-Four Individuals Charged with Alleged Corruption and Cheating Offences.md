a bribe of S$3,500 from a director of a company, as a reward to further
the business interests of RIMC with the said director’s company, which

<p>3. Between 20 July 2023 and 14 November 2023, over three occasions, Jeganathan

be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment not exceeding five
years or to both. Any person convicted of a cheating offence under Section
420 of the&nbsp;<em>Penal Code </em>can be sentenced to imprisonment of
up to 10 years and liable to a fine. Any person convicted of an amalgamated
charge punishable under Section 124(8)(a)(ii) of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em> can
face twice the amount of punishment liable for that offence.</p>
