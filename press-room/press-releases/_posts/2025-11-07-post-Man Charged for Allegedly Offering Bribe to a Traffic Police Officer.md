<p>On 7 November 2025, Lee Keh Meng (“Lee”) (44-year-old male Malaysian National)
was charged in Court for allegedly offering a bribe to a Traffic Police
(“TP”) Officer.</p>
<p>2. On 23 October 2025, Lee allegedly offered a bribe of S$50 to Sergeant
Ahmad Hafiz Bin Abdul Sukur (“Sergeant Hafiz”), as an inducement not to
report a case of unauthorised cross-border ride-hailing service. Sergeant
Hafiz rejected the bribe, and the case was subsequently referred to the
Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”) by the Singapore Police
Force. For his alleged action, Lee faces one charge punishable under Section
6(b) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>.</p>
<p>3. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em> can
be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment not exceeding five
years or to both.</p>
