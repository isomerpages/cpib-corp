<p>On 10 November 2025, Song Yong Pang, Benjamin (“Song”) (37-year-old male
Singaporean), a captain of the Singapore Armed Forces (“SAF”) at the material
time of the offences, was charged in Court for alleged cheating offences.</p>
<p>2. Sometime between 23 May 2021 to 26 March 2024, over multiple occasions,
Song allegedly cheated 16 individuals into giving him monies totalling
S$145,250. Song deceived these individuals into believing that the monies
were used either for investments or to pay for his mother’s medical bills.
Instead, Song used these monies to service his debts and expenses. For
his alleged actions, Song faces 18 charges for offences punishable under
Section 420 of the <em>Penal Code</em>, of which 13 are amalgamated charges
under Section 124(4) of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em> and punishable
under Section 124(8)(a)(ii) of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em>.</p>
<p>3. Any person convicted of a cheating offence under Section 420 of the <em>Penal Code</em> can
be sentenced to imprisonment of up to 10 years and liable to a fine. Any
person convicted of an amalgamated charge punishable under Section 124(8)(a)(ii)
of the <em>Criminal Procedure Code</em> can face twice the amount of punishment
liable for that offence.</p>
