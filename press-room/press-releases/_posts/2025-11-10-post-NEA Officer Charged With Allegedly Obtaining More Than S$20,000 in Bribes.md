<p>On 10 November 2025, Abdul Salam Jahabar Sadiq (“Salam”) (47-year-old
male Indian National and Singapore Permanent Resident), a Verification
Officer in the Burial Operations Section with the National Environment
Agency (“NEA”) at the material time of the offences, was charged in Court
with alleged corruption offences. The case was referred to CPIB by NEA.</p>
<p>2. Between 2022 to 2023, over multiple occasions, Salam allegedly obtained
bribes in the form of loans totalling about S$21,000 from 10 individuals
whose companies provide funeral-related services or cemetery-related works.
The bribes were an inducement to refrain from reporting any malpractices
committed by the 10 said individuals.</p>
<p>3. For his alleged actions, Salam faces 10 charges for offences under
Section 6(a) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>, of which two
charges are amalgamated pursuant to Section 124(4) and punishable under
Section 124(8)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Code.</p>
<p>4. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the Prevention
of Corruption Act can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment
not exceeding five years or to both. Any person convicted of an amalgamated
charge punishable under Section 124(8)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure
Code can face twice the amount of punishment liable for that offence.</p>
<p>5. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) looks into all corruption-related
complaints and reports, <strong><u>including anonymous ones</u></strong>,
and can be reached via the following channels:</p>

<p>6. Where possible, the report should include the following information:</p>
<p>a) Where, when and how did the alleged corrupt act happen?
<br>b) Who was involved and what were their roles?
<br>c) What was the bribe given and the favour shown?</p>
<p>7. Under the law, the identity of the person making the report will be
kept confidential, except when the court finds that the person has made
a false statement in his corruption complaint. Complainants may also choose
not to reveal their personal details when lodging a corruption complaint.</p>
