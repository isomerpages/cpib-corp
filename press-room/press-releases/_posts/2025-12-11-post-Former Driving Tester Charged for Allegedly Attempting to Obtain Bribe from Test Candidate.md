<p>On 11 December 2025, Muhamad Zahirey Bin Ishak (“Zahirey”) (39-year-old
male Singaporean), a driving tester with People Advantage Pte Ltd deployed
to Bukit Batok Driving Centre (“BBDC”) at the material time of the offence,
was charged in Court for an offence under the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>.</p>
<p>2. On 23 May 2025, Zahirey allegedly attempted to obtain S$150 from a
driving test candidate at BBDC, as a reward for showing leniency during
the candidate’s practical driving test so that the candidate could qualify
for a Singapore Driving Licence. For his alleged action, Zahirey faces
one charge punishable under Section 6(a) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>.</p>
<p>3. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em> can
be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment not exceeding five
years or both.</p>
