</p>
<p>2. On separate occasions between 2019 and 2021, Thangavel and Lai allegedly
gave bribes<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> </a>to
a senior procurement engineer at ALSG. Moreover, Kalimuthu allegedly conspired
with Sandran to give bribes to the same senior procurement engineer. The
bribes totalling S$160,000 were either inducements or rewards to further
the business interests of Toyah, Technihub IEA and RCS with ALSG.</p>
<p>3. For their alleged actions, Thangavel and Lai each face one charge under
Section 6(b) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act (“PCA”)</em>. Kalimuthu
and Sandran each face two charges under Section 6(b) read with Section
29 of the <em>PCA</em>, of which one is an amalgamated charge under Section

of up to S$125,000 to Sundarraj as an inducement to further the business
interests of LDC with ALSG.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;On two separate occasions between December 2019 and September
2022, Lim allegedly conspired with Ng and Sundarraj to falsify two invoices
amounting to S$179,570 as payments for works that were purportedly provided
by LDC and Voltz Engineering Works Pte Ltd (a company operated by Sundarraj),
which were in fact never performed.</p>

allegedly conspired with Sundarraj to falsify two invoices amounting to
about S$130,000 as payments to Voltz Engineering Works Pte Ltd for works
that were purportedly provided by Bharath Electrical, which were in fact
never performed. These payments represented benefits from criminal conduct
of another individual, and they were allegedly found to be in Suriamoorthy’s
possession.</p>
<p>9. During the same period on two separate occasions, Suriamoorthy allegedly
conspired with Vedaiyan to falsify two invoices amounting to S$113,200
as payments to Bharath Electrical for works that were purportedly provided

found to be in Vedaiyan’s possession.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;For their alleged actions, Suriamoorthy and Vedaiyan face four
charges and two charges, respectively, for an offence punishable under
Section 477A read with Section 109 of the <em>Penal Code</em>. In addition,
they each face two charges for an offence under Section 47(3) and punishable
under 47(6)(a) of the <em>Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act</em>  <em>(Cap. 65A, 2000 Rev. Ed.)</em>.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.

be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment not exceeding five

<p>12. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) looks into all corruption-related
complaints and reports, <strong><u>including anonymous ones</u></strong>,
