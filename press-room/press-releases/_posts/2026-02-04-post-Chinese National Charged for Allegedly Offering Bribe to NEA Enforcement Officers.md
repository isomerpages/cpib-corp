<p>On 4 February 2026,&nbsp;<strong>Lin Qin</strong>&nbsp;(“Lin”) (林琴, 38-year-old
female Chinese National) was charged in Court for allegedly offering a
bribe to two National Environment Agency (NEA) enforcement officers. She
is on a social visit pass to Singapore.</p>
<p>2. On 30 September 2025, Lin allegedly offered a bribe of S$120 to NEA
enforcement officers Koh Jun Song and Wai Mei Ying to refrain from taking
enforcement action against her for smoking in a non-designated area near
Lucky Plaza along Orchard Road. The NEA enforcement officers rejected the
bribe, and the case was subsequently referred to the Corrupt Practices
Investigation Bureau (CPIB). For her alleged action, Lin faces one charge
punishable under Section 6(b) of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em>.</p>
<p>3. Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption.
Any person convicted of a corruption offence under Section 6 of the <em>Prevention of Corruption Act</em> can
be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to imprisonment not exceeding five
years or both.</p>
<p>4. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) looks into all corruption-related
complaints and reports, <strong><u>including anonymous ones</u></strong>,

a false statement in his corruption complaint. Complainants may also choose
not to reveal their personal details when lodging a corruption complaint.</p>
