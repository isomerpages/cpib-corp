<p>Singapore has retained its standing as the world’s third least corrupt
country out of 182 countries, according to the latest rankings by the Transparency
International Corruption Perceptions Index (TI-CPI).&nbsp; With a score
of 84 which is same as last year, Singapore has also maintained its top
country ranking in the Asia Pacific region. The TI-CPI ranks and measures
countries based on perceived levels of public sector corruption. The 2025
index draws upon 13 expert assessments and business surveys.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;The corruption situation in Singapore remains firmly under control.
The number of public sector corruption cases remains low. The public perception
surveys conducted by the CPIB show strong public support and confidence
in the country’s corruption control efforts.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Singapore also ranked well in two other international reports.
In the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index 2025, Singapore ranked second
for absence of corruption, the top Asian nation out of 143 countries. In
the 2025 Report on Corruption by the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy
(PERC), Singapore received the best score out of 16 economies in Asia,
the US and Australia.</p>
<p>4. Singapore’s strong performance in the 2025 TI-CPI is underpinned by
robust legislations, effective enforcement, and a vigilant society united
by a shared commitment to integrity. This zero-tolerance towards corruption
and collective determination to do the right thing remain the cornerstone
of Singapore’s enduring reputation as a clean and corrupt-free nation.
