<p>Director CPIB, Mr Sam Tee,
<br>ISCA CEO Ms Fann Kor,
<br>Members of the Anti-Corruption Partnership Network,
<br>Distinguished guests,
<br>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>Let me begin by thanking the organisers, CPIB and ISCA, for inviting me
to this year’s Anti-Corruption Partnership Network, or ACPN, event.</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This gathering brings together an
important community who share a common purpose: to strengthen Singapore’s
resilience against corruption. Your presence here is a strong signal of
our shared commitment and demonstrates the strength of the public and private
sector partnership that underpins our anti-corruption efforts.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Singapore’s Anti-Corruption Foundation</strong>
</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore’s journey against corruption
is quite documented and well known, but it bears repeating – to remind
ourselves of the core and enduring values we must continue to uphold in
order to keep ourselves strong and clean.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our strong stance against corruption
began from the early years of independence. We understood then that corruption
is in itself corrosive. Even a small act of compromise, if left unchecked,
can snowball over time —creating a culture where unethical behaviour becomes
normalised. This is not something we want. Corruption erodes trust, weakens
institutions, and hollows out the moral fabric of our societies. With strong
political will, robust anti-corruption legislations and strict enforcement
actions, these three things, we successfully weeded out corruption which
was very rampant during the early years. As our Founding Prime Minister,
the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew once said:</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>“<em>Singapore has to keep fighting corruption…. We have to keep our own house clean. No one else can do it for us</em>.”</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The corruption situation in Singapore
today is well under control due to our zero-tolerance policy and approach.
It is a principle that guides our governance, enabled us to build a clean
and trusted system over the years and formed a strong foundation for us
to prosper and do well as a nation.</p>
<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our achievements are recognised
by the international community. Singapore was ranked third out of 180 countries
in the <em>Transparency International - Corruption Perceptions Index 2024</em> and
was the top ranked country within the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Domestically, Singaporeans view
corruption as well under control. In the 2024 CPIB Public Perception Survey,
97% of respondents rated our anti-corruption efforts favourably. Still,
we must not relent. Sustained progress requires strong public-private partnerships,
as well as ongoing adaptation and vigilance.</p>
<p><strong>Changes in the Global and Regional Corruption Landscape</strong>
</p>
<p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today’s global and regional corruption
landscape is increasingly complex. Varying levels of commitment and uneven
progress can send really mixed signals, embolden bad actors, and complicate
enforcement efforts. The use of sophisticated technologies and cross-border
networks further complicates and challenges detection and accountability.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a small country, Singapore has
no room for complacency. In an era of intense global competition for talent,
innovation, and investment, we must remain a trusted place for business,
with clear rules and processes, and fundamentally corruption free.</p>
<p><strong>Private Sector’s Role in Fighting Corruption</strong>
</p>
<p>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The private sector plays a key role in partnering
CPIB to keep the system clean. I want to thank the many companies, professional
bodies, and associations who are here today for walking this journey together
with us.</p>
<p>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year’s theme <em>“The Role of Forensic Accounting in Combatting Corruption”</em> is
timely. In an increasingly digital and complex world, forensic accounting
is key to uncovering patterns and also detecting anomalies. For the professional
accountants and auditors who are here today, you are uniquely positioned
to be guardians of trust – to detect misconduct and uphold governance standards.
For the corporate leaders, strong controls, and ethical leadership are
key to sustaining this culture for your company and for Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Value of the ACPN Platform</strong>
</p>
<p>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since its inception in 2018, the ACPN has been
a key enabler—growing into a trusted platform for dialogue, learning, and
joint problem-solving. Through it, CPIB has built strong ties with industries
and professional bodies to strengthen prevention upstream. This collaborative
effort empowers members like you to uphold Singapore’s reputation as a
trusted, corruption-free business hub.</p>
<p><strong>Recognition of Ethical Actions</strong>
</p>
<p>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, we recognise ten individuals who have
done the right thing, by rejecting bribes in the course of their work and
doing so when there are no people watching.</p>
<p>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me share two highlights.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>First, ICA Sergeant Nurliana Binte Mohamad Sufian rejected a bribe offered
in exchange for overlooking contraband cigarettes found in the car boot
of a private-hire vehicle of the offender at the Woodlands Checkpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In another case, Certis auxiliary police officer, Hemadharshini Shanmugam,
in carrying out enforcement duties under the National Environment Agency
turned down a bribe to look the other way when he caught a man throwing
a cigarette butt into the drain. CPIB was notified and the subjects were
arrested and charged.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These officers’ rejection of bribe offers may
appear to be something simple, small, but they are powerful signals. In
moments like these, integrity is tested, not in grand gestures, but in
quiet actions and choices made by our people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Star Partner and Appreciation Awards</strong>
</p>
<p>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years, several entities and individuals
have supported CPIB in the fight against corruption in significant ways.
This year, we will recognise one individual and one company for their invaluable
contributions. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Eugene Tan, Associate Professor at SMU’s Yong
Pung How School of Law, is a strong advocate of anti-corruption. He has
supported CPIB by integrating its message into his academic and executive
education programmes. He has also highlighted CPIB’s commitment at forums
like the UNCAC review, reinforcing that fighting corruption is a joint
and shared responsibility.</p>
<p>18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I would like to commend the Credit Bureau
Singapore, CBS, for being instrumental in supporting CPIB’s investigation
work. With your support, the time required to obtain credit and loan reports
of person under investigation has reduced substantially and this has contributed
to the early completion of many of the complex investigation papers.</p>
<p>19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Congratulations and big thanks to Eugene and
CBS for the partnership.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p>20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To conclude, let me commend all of you once
again for your convictions and partnerships with CPIB in keeping our country
corruption free. We’ve come this far. As we mark SG60, we look ahead with
steadfast resolve to uphold our values of integrity and incorruptibility.</p>
<p>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you and wishing all of you a pleasant
and fruitful day ahead.</p>
